    <h2><a href="../../../../../posts/2012/May/12/sebs-stag/">Sebs Stag</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 12 May 2012</h3>
        
      <p>Saturday was Seb's stag do which was set to be go-karting, comedy club and a night out. I left home at around 9am bound
for Ben's place and from there we continued to <a href="http://www.cannonraceway.co.uk/">Coseley Go karting</a> (via a few wrong turns because Ben knew better
than the sign that said "Go Karting this way"). Yes, their website does have a video that starts playing loud music as soon
as you load the home page, no I do not know who thought that was a good idea. We managed to somehow arrive bang on time and met a few new faces
and saw a few old ones too. It had been a very long time since I had last seen Rob and Seb, about 2 years!
We wandered in and got suited up, registered etc... and George managed to turn up mid-briefing so we were all sorted and
ready to go. The karting consisted of 10 seeding laps followed by a 60 lap race. The karting was pretty good fun
and I was pretty surprised how much it made my arms hurt, drifting over the small bumps in the floor really, really
hurt! Unfortunately I had to pull off after about 20 laps (was in 4th at the time, out of 10) due to my back bneing in
agony. It's probably worth mentioning that I had a massive crash on my mtb Friday evening...</p>
<p>Once I'd pulled off I stood in the spectator area and watched everyone else. There were plently of spins and crashes and
quite a few diagonal flags were shown. This was the flag that signified that you were driving too recklessly and to
calm it down or you'd get pulled into the pits for a "chat". About 40 laps in I saw someone get the diagonal flag and then
hit someone else pretty hard mid-lap, sure enough they got the special yellow and orange checked flag and had to pull in.
Probably could have already guessed who it would be and the number 2 on the front confirmed my suspicion - it was Ben. Sadly for
him he was in first at the time! A few more uneventful laps and the race was over. Rob won with Seb in second place, Ben managed 6th despite
having been pulled into the pits! I, obviously, came in last!</p>
<p>Karting over we headed into the centre of Birminham to the hotel. This took quite a while longer than planned too. Rob and
George were following us in the car behind and after driving for quite some time rang through to ask if we knew where
we were going because they thought that we'd passed where we wanted to turn off about 10 minutes before. At this point
we had to admit that no, we didn't have a clue! But, no harm done, we turned around and headed back int he right direction,
we parked up in the very busy multi-storey carpark next door to the travelodge for a pretty sum of Â£3 for 24 hours, can't
complain about that really - pretty good! Travelodge was as expected, a travelodge. We showered, changed etc... and headed
to Jimmy Spices. This place was an all you can eat buffet of a load of different cuisines. I tried quite a variety of
the food on offer and really enjoyed their butter chicken. Somehow, despite taking it easy, managed to eat too much
and felt pretty bloated for the next hour or so after, fairly typical.</p>
<p>Once we'd been fed we headed toward the <a href="http://www.thehighlight.co.uk/">Highlight</a> comedy club via a pint or 2 in Spoons. We arrived in Highlight
to find that Paul had ordered the Stag package so we had a table right at the very front of the stage, could already
see the fear in Seb's eyes! We also had table service which we all cunningly managed to forget time and again. Ben bought
a 4 pint pitcher for the 2 of us and that did us for the duration of the time that we were in there. I'm not going to lie,
I can't remember the names of any of the comedians. Tell a lie I just remembed the compere was Rudi Lickwood. He was very good,
loads of laughs and kept coming back to pick on Seb a bit and tell him the woes of married life. The other comedians were also
very good including a sort of slap stick duo who had a very, very clever act. I was quite amazed at how little heckling there was,
anyone who tried pretty rapidly got shot down and made to look a fool by the act that was on at that time.</p>
<p>After the comedy club we headed to Gatecrasher, this was the part of the night that I hadn't been looking forward to so much!
Once we were in we went for a short walk to see what rooms etc... there were and wound up at a bar overlooking the main dancefloor.
We were quite quickly joined by a group of very skimpily dressed girls with very odd makeup and cans strapped to their heads. They
turned out to be the dancers, still no idea what the get-up was all about - very odd! Ben, Rob and I bought a round of JD and cokes each,
at 12 quid a round, 1 round was enough! At about 1am everyone headed to the dancefloor so George and I decided to head back
to the hotel, Gatecrasher wasn't really our scene, especially not the dancing part! Ben came back a while after us and then Rob
came in later on, Rob had come back with the others and somehow Paul had managed to get his phone stolen, he was rather drunk!</p>
<p>In the morning we had a pretty average breakfast in the hotel but at least it was unlimited and had a coffee machine! Once we'd
eaten and grabbed our stuff we all said our goodbyes and headed off. Next time I'll see Seb will be his wedding in July I suspect.
All in all it was an enjoyable day, a bit pricey but I had fun and I'm pretty sure that Seb did too so job's a good'un!</p>
