    <h2><a href="http://chvck.co.uk/posts/2013/Mar/10/nettlebed-ride/">Nettlebed Ride</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 10 Mar 2013</h3>
        
      <p>Today I was due to head over to Christmas Common to do the route in Rough Ride Guide with Ben. Last night I got a handful of texts from him saying that he'd
locked himself out of his room and then another this morning saying that he was still locked out and not going to make it.
I suggested to George that we headed out for a ride in the afternoon and he agreed, I didn't fancy the full 40k of the
Christmas Common ride so chose the 30k Nettlebed ride. The guide suggested that this route holds up pretty well in the wet so it sounded
fairly ideal. We headed over at about lunch time.</p>
<p>We got there, got out of the car and it was bloody cold! We set off and pretty quickly picked up an offroad trail. The first half of the loop
was pretty great, there we lots of fast descent although not too techy but with little bits to try jump off etc... It was also almost all off-road
which was pretty nice. About 1/4 of the way in we bumped into a lady who flagged us down to help work out where we were. Turns out that she'd walked
a lot further than she thought and kept saying that she always walks too far and doesn't realise how far she's gone! We helped her work out where she was
and then continued on our way. At this point we did another fast descent that was also really quite long. This dropped us into Henley.</p>
<p>We rode through Henley and picked up a trail the other side, this is where it started getting really muddy. This bit of trail was a quick downhill
followed by 2km of uphill, not very steep and should have been simple. But no, it was majorly churned up and muddy. In quite a few areas we just gave up
and walked. We also stopped here for a spot of lunch next to this: </p>

<p>I checked the map and it seemed that the second half of the ride was to be uphill, it wasn't wrong. It was also pretty muddy most of the way.
Although, we did go through a pretty flat wood that would be good fun in the dry. We managed to hit the last bit of road and go the wrong way, 
I misread the map so we wound up heading away from Nettlebed, not toward. Due to this and it starting to get a bit dark we skipped the last bit of 
offroad and just followed the road all the way back.</p>
<p>All in all a good ride, pretty good fun and should be pretty awesome in the dry! Since starting injecting meds I'm finding hills to be a major 
issue, there's just nothing in my legs. I'm hoping that I can just ride through it! We wound up doing 30km so not a bad effort. I'm also really enjoying
the bike, it just feels great and really inspires me to want to have fun on it.</p>
