    <h2><a href="../../../../.././posts/2012/May/06/dyfi-enduro-weekend/">Dyfi Enduro Weekend</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 06 May 2012</h3>
        
      <p>This weekend marked the annual Dyfi Enduro event. A couple of the old abermtb group were coming
back for this and it was shipping up to be a good weekend of riding. Ben was, as usual, staying with
me and we arranged to meet Joe, Stu, Paul and Andy over at Capel Dewi at 11 for a bit of downhill
before heading to Nant-y-arian at 2. Before setting out in the morning Ben and I had the simple,
single, task of changing my brakes pads. As is always the way, this was not a simple task.
The brake pads themselves took a lot of convincing to get in and even after letting some oil
out of the system there was no way the rotor was going in! After much wasted time, I remembered that
I had a partially worn set of contaminated pads. With a bit of convincing we got the rotor to go in
with these pads fitted. However, we had cunningly managed to let air into the system so we pissed about
bleeding the brake for a while till we had a fantastic lever but a rear wheel that didn't spin freely!
We figured it'd do.</p>
<p>En-route to Capel Dewi (running late) I received a fun phone call from my Dad informing me
that I'd been caught speeding when I went down to Oxford. This was shaping up to be a bit
of a crap day. I couldn't get my head in the game at Capel Dewi but we hit up a few runs
and I still had fun. The ride up Nant-y-arian went much better! We met up with a group of
Paul's mates from Norwich in the carpark and set out. The trails were riding really nice
and the climbs felt pretty good, we even snuck in secret Zorro. Such a fun descent featuring
drops, singletrack, scree slopes, jumps, all in all pretty rad! First ride in a while where I
came bvack totally dry too, always good!</p>
<p>Bright and early Sunday morning we headed for Machynlleth to park up and sign on for the event.
Race plates fitted (701 here) and bikes ready to go we (Ben and I) joined the ever growing queue of riders
and their bikes waiting for the starting gates to open. After a bit of a light hearted briefing
the gates opened and the riders were off. After the usual stop and starting we managed to get through the gates
5-10 minutes later! Letting off 7-800 riders in one go through a small gateway is never going to be a smooth flow
really! We hit the road and Ben had already managed to get ahead of me so I rode as quickly as
I could along the road overtaking people where I could and being overtaken plenty too. After a few miles
we hit the first offroad climb, I knew that there was no way I'd be catching Ben now so I decided to
just sit back and enjoy myself and ride at my own pace to try see how quickly I could get round.</p>

<p style="font-size: small; text-align: center;">Riders waiting for the gates to open</p></p>
<p>The first climb was a long slog of a fire road but I knew that it was coming and paced myself
to sit and spin away, think I even managed to overtake more than I was overtaken! Managed to have a brief chat
with Dave Reed before he raced off ahead. Just before the
top the climb switches back on itself in a big open corner, they usually have a band here but this
time round they had a harp being played - pretty cool! At the top of the climb saw a group of cheerleaders
urging us on, I was contemplating stopping for a rest but decided to push on to try get to
the top of the first descent as quickly as possible to try get a clear run.</p>
<p>Top of Elephant I was ready to go and even though I was following someone we were going
quick enough for me to hit the first kicker. Unfortunately overtaking opportunities were pretty
scarse on this descent as it's rather narrow. Before even reaching the first corner we somehow
found ourselves queueing up stationary. Still not sure why but eventually we started moving again,
we hit the first corner and the guy in front of my looked somewhat out of his depth and managed to fall off!
I quickly checked he was OK and then set off again before getting stuck behind someone else. No matter,
got the end of the descent and prepared myself for climbing for quite some time. The course took us fairly directly up to the
field climb where the uphill gets a bit more technical. For some reason my camelbak resevoir was refusing to
let me drink anything so by this point I was getting a bit parched having not drank anything since before we started. I made it most of
the way over the field before stopping and draining half of my water bottle. I then hit the really steep bit of the climb and
just as i hit the top I heard a familiar voice and Andy and Stu appeared. Despite them both saying they'd be really
unfit and slow they must have been going pretty quickly!</p>
<p>I decided to try to stick with them and following them down the descents was rather good although Andy is
still somewhat reckless and made some rather interesting overtakes. The descents were all running nicely
and plenty of overtaking was on the cards. I lost them at the new technical climb, I was off and pushing, as
was everyone around me - not a fun climb really. The next time that I saw them was at the bottom of the World Cup descent which was, as always, utterly
rad. The big dipper before it was quite entertaining with some massive puddles and plenty of people complaining, I
managed to ride through the middle of the lot (well, walked one after stopping in the middle). Between big dipper and World Cup
is a small climb through some trees, as I rode into the trees I could hear the iconic Star Wars music getting louder and louder.
I rounded a corner and there it was, a group of people dressed up in Star Wars outfits and battling with light sabres, it was
a nice distraction and helped to keep things interesting! I kept up with Andy and Stu
for the start of the long, grueling climb from World Cup to the feed station but they pretty quickly shot off in the distance.
After quite a long time I hit this final leg of the climb and got a bit of a kick and picked up the pace, just as I hit
the top I bumped into Ben. Unfortunately his seat post clamp had exploded at the bottom of World Cup so he'd been
riding the entire climb stood up - not much fun!</p>
<p>At the feed station we found Andy and Stu again and stocked up on food and liquids (Stu left with more food than he started with!), we ended up being there for
about half an hour! During this time we bumped into a couple more faces we knew and Paul also turned up. At this point
the 5 of us set off together and pretty much just rode the rest of the way together. Ben was still pedalling stood up
right through to the end which kept him reigned in riding at our pace! A couple more descents and another crap climb or two saw
Paul and I at the top of 3in1 having been told that this would be the end we decided we'd take it easy down and just try to stay
in 1 piece. Paul flew off and I knew that there was no way we were taking it easy. We hurtled down and it was grins all round at the bottom,
despite Paul taking us through a tree. At the bottom we were greated by a pretty surreal sight of a beer tent with a disco.
We were given a free beer each and we couldn't be happier! We waited for Ben and then rolled down to the finish line. We finished in one
minute under 5 hours, not quite as quick as I'd planned but still my best time by quite some way! It was also unfortunate that
we didn't get to do the final descent but seeing that arrow pointing to the finish area not a big old climb up to
the final descent was very, very welcome!</p>

<p style="font-size: small; text-align: center;">Always a good sign!</p></p>
<p>We pedalled back down into Machynlleth to the main event area to get our Dyfi Enduro mugs and to have a bit of a sit down and a natter
before heading back to Aber. An ace day of riding was topped off with a lovely meal in the Tynllidiart Arms in Capel Bangor.
A really great couple of days riding with a great group of people. Here's looking forward to next year!</p>
