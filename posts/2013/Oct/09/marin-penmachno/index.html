    <h2><a href="http://chvck.co.uk/posts/2013/Oct/09/marin-penmachno/">Marin & Penmachno</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 09 Oct 2013</h3>
        
      <p>Before starting the guts of this post I just want to mention that after previous riding
this week my body was pretty sore and aching so that may bias my opinions on these trails. Pedalling
downhill pretty much just wasn't an option either. Going to be utterly ruined by Sunday - got Hopton, Dyfi and Eastridge to ride yet!</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.mbwales.com/en/content/cms/bases/betws_y_coed/marin_trail/marin_trail.aspx">Marin trail</a></h2>
<p>I met Harris at the Marin car park at about 11.15, the reason we didn't go up together
was that he went via coed-y-brenin carpark to try find the rear maxle he lost on Sunday.
He did indeed find it, huzzah! I'd done the Marin a few times before but not for a long time.
Despite what a lot of people say on the internet I remembered really enjoying the Marin and it
being one of my favourite trail centres. </p>
<p><img alt="Marin map" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9ZYtT8kZihI/UlWVQrJbSGI/AAAAAAAADj4/NSmbgEpxRYc/s640/P1000392.JPG" /></p>
<p>Despite starting out with a singletrack climb, most of the Marin climbs are just nice fireroad spins.
I know that some people seem to dislike climbing on fireroads but to me it's the best way to do it, spin
away and conserve that energy for descending. Even on the first climb I could feel that my legs were still
recovering from the coedy enduro, a bit sore and hollow feeling. </p>
<p><img alt="Fireroad" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ojmQxcTsJPc/UlWVWBID9QI/AAAAAAAADkI/1LeHpEE8JTA/s640/P1000393.JPG" /></p>
<p>For the most part singletrack on the Marin trail is descending and good descending at that. There are some cracking descents there, the final one (Ride Fast Ride Free) being
really quite excellent - and pretty long to boot. Another couple of descents that I can actually remember (so must
have been of note) were "Pigs might fly" and "Dragon's Tail". </p>
<p>It took us 2 hours to do the 23km at a casual, sore pace so it'd be doable for us in well under that. It's a cracking
bit of trail and is staying there as one of my favourite trail centres.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.mbwales.com/en/content/cms/Bases/Betws_y_Coed/Penmachno/Penmachno.aspx">Penmachno trail</a></h2>
<p>After the Marin we headed down to Penmachno unsure whether we'd do just one or both loops. By this point
it had started to try to rain a bit but was generally still decent weather. We started out on a fireroad climb,
rounded a corner and <em>WHOOSH</em> very gusty wind right into our faces, luckily this wind seemed to disappear at this 50m section!
This trail has a lot of singletrack, it also has its share of fireroad but the ratio of ST:fireroad was higher than
most trail centres that I've ridden. Unfornately, a lot of that singletrack is uphill or flat and the entire thing is
very rough. Harris was having a hard time of it on a hardtail.</p>

<p>Before the split for loop 1 or loop 2 (does an extra loop + loop 1) we had done 1 descent, and it was mediocre at that.
This led us to a decision that we'd only do loop 1 as this sort of trail just isn't our cup of tea. Luckily, it got 
better. Something worth mentioning is that this trail has a lot of fantastic views which at least redeems some of the horrible
climbing. There were 1 or 2 more decent descents before the final 2. The final 2 descents were good, the final 1 being
really good. Rocky, fairly challenging and fast. Oh, no need to pedal to feel fast either, just pumping - that's always high on my list
of desireable things from a descent. They were fast enough to pretty exciting (especially if you didn't hit your line right) but also
technical enough to be fun and a bit challenging. I love the feeling of barrelling along on trails that have a bit of something about them, 
really good feeling that is. The last 2 were what I've come to expect from Wales - they were very wet and very rocky with some steepish bits.</p>

<p>I think that I'd go back and do either of them but I'd take the Marin over Penmachno. If you go and only have time to do one then don't do either!
Instead, just do the final descents of both :)</p>
