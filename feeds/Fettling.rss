was to drop the travel on the Lyriks (solo air) a tad - giving me a lower front end for the
steep stuff. The first step here was to consider the options available, two options
presented themselves to me. 1 - convert to coil uTurn, 2 - use Rock Shox all travel
spacers. The second step was to decide what travel I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Option 1 was by far the more preferable here, uTurn allows for on the fly adjustment meaning
that I could easily wind the travel down when I wanted to and wind it back out for when I
go to the alps. This also means that I could play with different amounts of travel until
I got a length that I felt ideal. The major downside to this option is the price. If
the parts are sourced new then a coil is £55, top out spring is £22, uTurn adjuster is
£25 and a sleeve for the coil (precent scratching the insides of the stanchions) is £7.
This puts the price of a conversion to over £100, quite a lot more than I was willing to pay,
coil can be sourced second hand but the rest is quite tricky to source unless buying new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I opted for option 2 - all travel spacers. After getting in touch with tftuned to
make sure that these would work with my '08 Lyriks (they're labelled for models 2010 onward)
I ordered a set for £12, if I was to do this again I'd just buy a hand ful of nylon washers.
Much cheaper and does the same job. These spacers are fitted inside of the air cartridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So forks in bits I started the job of taking the air cart apart. This is not a fun job,
between the two ends of the circlip that holds the main body in the stanchion is a little tab.
The first step is to push down on the base plate and turn it to move this tab out of the way.
It rapidly became apparent that the circlip turns with the base plate, cue much swearing and
pissing about. Eventually I got the circlip off and was presented with a totally different
set of internals to the ones shown in the guide I was following (&lt;a href="http://cdn.sram.com/cdn/farfuture/Iyagqzgz8FKPfRtQtkQ7kGP6DaHWJx6hmeiu3n9ZPTA/mtime:1302539000/sites/default/files/techdocs/tm_my102.pdf"&gt;2010 manual&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major difference here is that the guide shows a negative air piston,
in the 08 model this piston is not present. Instead there is a little gromit that seals onto
the base plate to perform the same (or similar) job. This immediately made me question
where I was supposed to place the spacer(s). After a bit of searching I located the 
&lt;a href="http://www.sram.com/_media/pdf/rockshox/dealers/TM_MY08_E.pdf"&gt;2008 manual&lt;/a&gt;
which showed me that I need to put the spacer above the bumper for the top piston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="images/lyriks.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job done I put the forks back together (spending ages pissing about with that circlip again) and took
the chance to refresh all the oil and lube any seals. It's really quite a simple process
to change the travel and I now have fully working, fantastic feeling 140mm Lyriks!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">chuck</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 19 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:chvck.co.uk,2012-04-19:posts/2012/Apr/19/lyriks-travel-reduction/</guid><category>bikes</category><category>bike-maintenance</category></item></channel></rss>
