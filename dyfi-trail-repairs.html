</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Today Dan, Gaz and I met up with the some of the locals to do some repairs
to a couple of the Dyfi enduro descents. We split into 2 groups and our group
went off to the top of the world cup descent to fill in a bit of a rut. The reasoning
behind this was that the 2 jumps near the beginning of the trail have been built up
a bit and the only real line leads straight into them! As such we filled in a bit of a massive
rut to provide a nice line that leads around the jumps. Think I'll have to hit the jumps
next Sunday, will be severely punished if I come up short though! </p>
<p>After filling in this rut we moved over to a piece of trail that I've not seen before
that will be used as a climb. It's fairly, steep and loose-ish, no surprises there. 
About midway up we met the second group clearing back some brash and draining a massive
puddle. Nothing much to do so we headed back down again. I get a feeling that I will
be off and pushing for this climb, it's hard!</p>
<p>Next up we headed to 3in1 to cut in a bit of a new line at the top to get round
the huge puddle there. Lots of raking and general moving of bits and pieces and there
is now a nice line that should be quite good to ride over. </p>
<p>Oh, also - the weather was utterly, utterly gopping! Howling wind and tipping down for the
most part. Dyfi Enduro is going to be weeeeet!</p>
