</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Dyfi enduro was yesterday so Ben and I decided that a bit of downhilling was in order,
had enough of riding uphill. We took the morning fairly easy and chilled before heading over
at around lunch time. We started out by hitting the top of the main line a couple of times, neither
of us really in the mood for a full push back up. It was riding fast and fun. We decided to try the new line
that the freshers have built as neither of us had ridden the full thing. Fair play to them, really, really
fun blast of a track. Nothing too technical but fast and jumpy. Since I had last ridden it they'd
added 2 massive berms and a big jump in at the bottom. The berms are big and ace to ride, the jump on the other hand
just isn't quite right. The takeoff is somewhat steep and short and the landing is tiny and too close! Every time
we hit it we were overshooting the landing to uphill which isn't all that great on a hardtail I can tell you!
But all in all they've done a good job, there are a couple of tricky bits that are slippery and off camber, I also managed
to have a bit of a stack trying to ride out a really cheeky bit of a line!</p>
<p>We also hit up the top of the wall ride track and spent ages working down a couple of the tracks taking photos
and generally messing about. Rad shred and great way to finish off the 3 day weekend!</p>
<p>A few photos from the day:</p>
