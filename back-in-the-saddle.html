</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The last time that I rode the mtb (prior to today) was the coedy enduro back in October.
That is seriously way too long to spend off the bike. This weekend Rich came over to Oxford to hang out
and we decided to ride somewhere. I still don't know much riding in the Oxford area but figured that
the Ridgeway was probably a decent bet for a bit of a pootle.</p>
<p>Bikes out and ready to go. Sun shining, no rain, small amount of wind, ideal. Off we went. Within about 50 metres
we discovered the general theme of the ride - MUD. So much mud. Oh and deep puddles with ice still in them, they were nice
too. We decided to ride both sides of the car and all in all it was a good day out, we did about 25km in about 3 hours,
so not exactly blistering pace but the mud was pretty much everywhere and fairly similar in characteristics to super glue.
The area of the Ridgeway itself that we rode was pretty flat, rolling hills is the phrase; I suppose. I'm hoping
to get back up there sometime soon but, ideally, when it's a bit drier! Come Summer I think that it'll be good fun
up there - it'll be very, very fast!</p>
<p>So, first ride in about 2 months and my legs were really hurting by the end. Despite a lack of hills I think that
the mud had a similar effect on my legs that hills do. Not ideal condition but nice to get out on the bike
and it was a nice day with some nice views!</p>
