    <h3>Posted on 18 Feb 2013</h3>
        
      <p>Firstly I'll start off with the demise of my photo a day. Quite simple - I just don't do enough varying things
in my day to day life. I found myself remembering that I hadn't taken a photo and having to hunt for something around the house.
That wasn't the way that I had wanted to do it, I'd wanted to just take a photo of something significant each day and not
had to think about taking the photo, just doing it. For that reason, I stopped.</p>
<p>Now let's talk bikes, surprise surprise. The Intense is pretty awesome and I'm very much enjoying riding it. I recently did a ride around
Boars Hill which is local to me and has very little elevation. Despite being on a totally inappropriate bike it was still good fun
and the Intense pedals much better and easier than I had expected. I've also changed my drivetrain and accidentally bought an 11-32 cassette, this
hasn't been an issue yet either which surprised me a little. I really need to get the bike over to some Welsh trails I know well to give it a proper
good testing.
    As we're on the subject, a couple of weeks ago we went to Forest of Dean which was pretty rad. We started out doing the blue loop which was quite flowy
and undulating. The final descent of it is pretty awesome. We also rode a few of the DH tracks; really good too! The weekend just gone we went to explore
around Birdlip near Gloucs. That was not so great, really deep thick mud everywhere. We did 25km in over 4 hours! I also swear that we didn't even do a single
semi-decent descent. We did quite a bit of hiking with the bikes too, which really destroyed my legs where I've recently jabbed. It turned into one of those
rides where I just wanted to be back at the car. Best bit of the ride was a pint &amp; fish n chips in the pub!
    On the jabs note, I recently discovered that my pack came with a cooling pad that lives in the fridge and you put on where you're about to jab.
Wow, I was pretty amazed at just how effective that thing is! Really takes away any pain at the time of doing it, doesn't stop it aching the next day mind but
that doesn't happen to me often anyway!</p>
