this week my body was pretty sore and aching so that may bias my opinions on these trails.
Going to be utterly ruined by Sunday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mbwales.com/en/content/cms/bases/betws_y_coed/marin_trail/marin_trail.aspx"&gt;Marin trail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Harris at the Marin car park at about 11.15, the reason we didn't go up together
was that he went via coed-y-brenin carpark to try find the rear maxle he lost on Sunday.
He did indeed find it, huzzah! I'd done the Marin a few times before but not for a long time.
Despite what a lot of people say on the internet I remembered really enjoying the Marin and it
being one of my favourite trail centres. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Marin map" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9ZYtT8kZihI/UlWVQrJbSGI/AAAAAAAADj4/NSmbgEpxRYc/s640/P1000392.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite starting out with a singletrack climb, most of the Marin climbs are just nice fireroad spins.
I know that some people seem to dislike climbing on fireroads but to me it's the best way to do it, spin
away and conserve that energy for descending. Even on the first climb I could feel that my legs were still
recovering from the coedy enduro, a bit sore and hollow feeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Fireroad" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ojmQxcTsJPc/UlWVWBID9QI/AAAAAAAADkI/1LeHpEE8JTA/s640/P1000393.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part singletrack on the Marin trail is descending and good descending at that. There are some cracking descents there, the final one (Ride Fast Ride Free) being
really quite excellent - and pretty long to boot. Another couple of descents that I can actually remember (so must
have been of note) were "Pigs might fly" and "Dragon's Tail". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took us 2 hours to do the 23km at a casual, sore pace so it'd be doable for us in well under that. It's a cracking
bit of trail and is staying there as one of my favourite trail centres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Stone structure" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-VNCOgYu4L5A/UlWWq-dtlUI/AAAAAAAADkk/9DuPz5P1fvs/s640/P1000396.JPG" /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mbwales.com/en/content/cms/Bases/Betws_y_Coed/Penmachno/Penmachno.aspx"&gt;Penmachno trail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Marin we headed down to Penmachno unsure whether we'd do just one or both loops. By this point
it had started to try to rain a bit but was generally still decent weather. We started out on a fireroad climb,
rounded a corner and &lt;em&gt;WHOOSH&lt;/em&gt; very gusty wind right into our faces, luckily this wind seemed to disappear at this 50m section!
This trail has a lot of singletrack, it also has its share of fireroad but the ratio of ST:fireroad was higher than
most trail centres that I've ridden. Unfornately, a lot of that singletrack is uphill or flat and the entire thing is
very rough. Harris was having a hard time of it on a hardtail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Craig Wen" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-npAQhas3IY8/UlWYrJCIFNI/AAAAAAAADlY/2KldNjwWhe0/s640/P1000403.JPG" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the split for loop 1 or loop 2 (does an extra loop + loop 1) we had done 1 descent, and it was mediocre at that.
This led us to a decision that we'd only do loop 1 as this sort of trail just isn't our cup of tea. Luckily, it got 
better. Something worth mentioning is that this trail has a lot of fantastic views which at least redeems some of the horrible
climbing. There were 1 or 2 more decent descents before the final 2. The final 2 descents were good, the final 1 being
really good. Rocky, fairly challenging and fast. Oh, no need to pedal to feel fast either, just pumping - that's always high on my list
of desireable things from a descent. They were fast enough to pretty exciting (especially if you didn't hit your line right) but also
technical enough to be fun and a bit challenging. I love the feeling of barrelling along on trails that have a bit of something about them, 
really good feeling that is. The last 2 were what I've come to expect from Wales - they were very wet and very rocky with some steepish bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that I'd go back and do either of them but I'd take the Marin over Penmachno. If you go and only have time to do one then don't do either!
Instead, just do the final descents of both :)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="riding"></category><category term="bikes"></category></entry><entry><title>Coed-y-brenin 2013</title><link href="http://chvck.co.uk/posts/2013/Oct/07/coed-y-brenin-2013/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-10-07T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>chuck</name></author><id>tag:chvck.co.uk,2013-10-07:posts/2013/Oct/07/coed-y-brenin-2013/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This weekend marked the annual Coed-y-brenin Enduro, a 60km mountain bike endurance event. Last year Ben and I did it, it took
us 8.5 hours (according to my gps) and we were nearly dead last. Felt utterly destroyed at the end and swore to never do it again.
Somehow, we wound up doing it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Saturday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been talking about Myherin to the others for a while now so put a plan in action to get it done. We met Dave Reed and Pete
in the arches car park and set about waiting for Ben and Rich to turn up. Which they did, 40 minutes late! Unfortunately, I wasn't 
feeling great so the descents were a bit hairy and the climbs just hurt. I cut the loop a bit short with Dave, we just skipped Blaen
Myherin whilst the others went off that way. We cut off at the steep climb and just headed back via Brashy Dive. I then met the others in
Aberystwyth. I think that they enjoyed the ride!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After grabbing some food for the evening we headed off up to our log cabin near Coed-y-brenin. It was pretty snug but had everything we needed
and was really comfy. At this point we also met up with 2 of Ben's mates who we were sharing the cabin with, Conrad and Nath. We cooked a big
ole pasta bake and then watched utterly dire films until bed time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The cabin" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GZNerN0dt7w/UlJ5vlO1zyI/AAAAAAAADfQ/zPVT01EoZds/s640/P1000364.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting out how all big bike days do - porridge and a cuppa tea. We packed up all of our stuff and headed off to coedy to sign up and get riding.
The sign on had moved this year down to the newly kitted out visitors centre, although we didn't go inside to have a look. By the time we got there 
and signed on, met up with Jase etc... it was about time to go join the starting queue. We opted to queue about 3/4 of the way back as we had no plans to go racing.
The first few km were slow and a tad stop/start until the pack thinned out. The first descent (cane &amp;amp; abel) was a fair queue although completely 
cleared by the time we hit the actual descent. This may have been because we pointed out a path near the descents and joked we should go ride that. A lot
of the people around us decided that, in fact, that was exactly what they were going to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Signed on" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3oMwMgUBOMo/UlJ95O-9hQI/AAAAAAAADgg/50tdLfhQchI/s640/P1000373.JPG" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="The start" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SrzynTAgh58/UlJ-vGFyviI/AAAAAAAADgw/qlLOrloPhus/s640/P1000374.JPG" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="First descent queue" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ivsqw7Es2HQ/UlKAv6GIPII/AAAAAAAADhc/PGdJysu_kA0/s640/P1000379.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ride had some great descents and a few tough climbs mixing up both fire track and singletrack. Of note were the steep, slippery, rad descent down to the river
(not trail centre) although I did hit a tree causing our mini-train to stop and then hit my pedal on a rock just before a chute causing another stop, although still
managed to ride them out. Sorry guys! Rocky horror near the end was also a good bit of trail although by that point my body felt like I'd been in a fight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Chute" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-GsTuoXSONy8/UlKC-5FTj2I/AAAAAAAADiE/2Z4gNUB7RGM/s640/P1000383.JPG" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an awesome weekend full of good riding. Will probably do the coedy again next year too, didn't feel nearly as bad this year - although didn't feel that ride during the ride.
Thanks to all the Summit crew who made it happen as well as the people manning the feed station and the emergency services crew(s?), and everyone else involved!&lt;/p&gt;

bit of riding prep in before Bean utterly destroys our legs. Harris, Rich and I
decided that we wanted to get a long ride in this weekend. As Rich lives near
good riding and now has his own house we decided to go ride there and stay for the weekend.
Unfortunately, Harris had been ill for a lot of last week and I got the text on Friday afternoon
saying that he wasn't going to make it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning Maura and myself set off for Rich's place, which is only about an away. We arrived
at about lunch, chilled out for a bit and then Rich and I decided we'd better go ride in the Lickey's.
The aim was for a decent sized ride but with the longer ride being Sunday. Gotta say I thought that the
Lickey's were pretty awesome, not a lot of elevation but loads of stuff to ride and a lot of it pretty
steep. Even some small drops and the like. There's plenty of potential there for a bit of cheeky building away from the
beaten path too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="View from Lickey's" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AiONVnsKKpU/UaxLU5ctR8I/AAAAAAAACgA/TkQDjpiicYo/s640/IMG_20130601_151854.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;View over Birmingham from above the golf course&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as we hit the first climb I could feel something was amiss, my legs were still aching
from Harris destroying them the Saturday before! Whilst I could happily spin away I felt like
I had no actual strength in them and that they were hollow. Luckily, most of the climbs were steep
but not too steep so I could spin them in 1st gear. We did about 26km and it took us 2 hours although
a reasonable chunk was on the road to and from the woods. I'm keen to get back there and explore some
more. The SLX brakes proved themselves to be a worth investment impressing me all the while. The rubber queens
were also good, less draggy as the high rollers but just as grippy - think I'll be using the larsens for
most of my riding over Summer though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Rubber Queen" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QZgvr32iPAE/UaxK_QUskSI/AAAAAAAACf4/M18OnJCbRNA/s640/IMG_20130530_121319.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Second hand RQ, plenty of life - bargain!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening we went for a curry which was pretty nice and then a couple of pubs. We wound up in a pub
near to Rich's house that had a live band which was a pretty awesome end to the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday, we had arrange to meet another Ben (Bish) at the Wyre at 11. Weeeell, that didn't happen - Rich and I
set off at 11 so we told them to just ride on and we'd bump into them somewhere. We actually wound up
arriving at the Wyre at 11.40. The Wyre was really dry and the descents there are pretty much all fast, flat out. Whilst that isn't
majorly my cup of tea (I prefer more techy stuff) it was awesome fun. There are a couple of pretty techy, steep descents that kept
the bag varied and the climbs are steep but fairly short. My legs felt much better for this ride and Rich was aching from the
previous ride so we had a pretty nice pace. I previously hadn't enjoyed riding the Wyre but 
it's certainly on my list of things worth riding now. In the end we did about 30km in about 2.5 hours (runkeeper managed 
to lose gps signal so not really sure!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Lovely day" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_PGpk6ooiUQ/UaxLuXyMyGI/AAAAAAAACgI/A7eDrqqQ65g/s640/IMG_20130602_120907.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;A lovely day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Lots of dry singletrack!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;My bike doesn't fit Rich's rack with the shock on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got back and chilled out for a bit before playing the bike fettling game. I bled my rear brake to try get it
as good as the front, I was not successful in that although it feels no worse than before. Rich decided to try
track down the horrible creak/cracking sound under load on his bike. We took his freehub off and it was pretty obvious,
the bearings quite literally fell out of the body in a number of pieces. So he's got some work to do before Scotland!
Rich then cooked a great chilli and after eating Maura and I returned to Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great weekend and hopefully many more to come in Rich's new place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Freehub" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8oGi_Hu1ucU/UaxMBSnEVjI/AAAAAAAACgw/C-aqtWYJo70/s640/IMG_20130602_182053.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;That doesn't look right&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;That's definitely not right&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore, I set out to plan a ride for this weekend and came across the Prospect Hospice 
Big Bike Ride by chance, a 50km ride over Swindon way. Ben came over on Saturday
so we did a quick 25km ride round Boars Hill and also had a bit of a play on the 
Dean Court dirt jumps - they're better than I been expecting. Good news!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday we headed over to Swindon and signed on for the 50km loop, turns out
that we had about 25 minutes to spare before the event started so had loads of
time! The start was staggered into small groups but we didn't have to wait long.
The first few km were on the croft trail which, from what we rode, seemed like pretty
good fun. It was long until we (us and the guy in front of us) caught up to the group 
in front and had to go a bit slower but pretty soon we were on double track off the trail
so could ride at our own pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the ride was on double track with a few single track descents (and one climb) and a bit
of road. We were pretty surprised by how hilly it was. There was even one road climb where, whilst
we were going up it, I was the only person who stayed on the bike! It was really good fun and a nice
day on the bikes. We were pushing quite hard to try to treat it as a bit of training for next weekend and
it fit the bill pretty well! Unfortunately I did have a crash, about 100m from the finish line. There were two
trees that we had to ride through and I found out the hard way that my bars didn't fit, oh well - no 
harm done :). Bring on the dyfi!&lt;/p&gt;

He found a jumps and drops course at Forest of Dean that is run by
&lt;a href="http://prorideguides.com/"&gt;Pro Ride Guides&lt;/a&gt;. We found a date and sent the info
on the others, it ended up being Ben, Taylor and myself booked onto the course.
Today we did the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to the Forest of Dean at about 9.30 and Taylor n Ben showed up shortly afterward.
Some faffing occured and we headed over to meet the 2 other guys and the coach - Dave, Chris and Al
respectively. We had a brief chat and did some basic bike checks so that Al knew that we weren't
riding death traps. We set out for a short spin on the blue route just to warm up a bit
and get a fresh feeling of our bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we'd done that we were at the top of a fireroad. Al explained how to correctly get into the 
attack position and how it should feel - he wanted us to be in that position with the rear brake 
covered for most of the day. Next he showed us how to correctly bring the bike into a manual (seems to be the key!) so we practised
that for a while before progressing it into a bunny hop. An emphasis over the day was landing softly so we
also had a go at that with the bunny hops. This part felt pretty good and already it was
pretty clear I've got a nice collection of bad habits!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then moved onto a small drop onto a fireroad to practise the technique for that. I was having some trouble with
not pogo-ing upward at this point, something of a bad habit there as well. After that we pedalled up to the top of the hill
and spent some time on a tabletop getting to grips with the jumping correctly part. This was also pretty difficult! We all
started to get the hang of it though. Then it was time for lunch so we continued down the trail to the bottom trying practise pumping and
jumping on our way down. He also told us to keep as light as possible on the bars so that front wheel can track better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch we returned to the small jumpy section where we had pactised the drops and setup on a jump that we could land
on top of but had a distinct take off and landing. We put what we'd learnt into practise gradually adding more speed to try clear
the jump. Ben managed to get the hang of it pretty quickly although he did almost attempt to superman off the front of the bike
at one point. I was finding that I was getting the technique right more often by now and could tell when I had as it felt much
better. Gradually adding speed it was all beginning to sink in. Once Al was happy that we were all capable of doing that he moved us onto
a pretty small drop into a relatively steep slope.  We spent some time putting into practise what we'd done earlier and everyone managed it
with no problems what-so-ever. During these 2 sections it was also interesting to watch other people (not on the course) coming down and
see how they were doing it wrong - with Al whincing almost every time in case they nailed themselves! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we'd got the hang of that drop we pedalled back to the top of the hill and played on a tabletop up there. At this point
Al also showed us how to manual tables so we had a crack at that - Chris was pretty good at it and Taylor managed to get it 
really well on his last attempt. Ben and I weren't so great - more practise needed! We then did the descent we had done earlier
trying to put into practise everything that we learnt but we said our goodbyes and headed off home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like I got a lot out of the course. Whilst I don't feel like I cracked it during the day it's given me 
the knowledge and theory that I needed so that I can come away and practise, practise, practise. Trying to practise
jumps and drops around Oxford might be difficult but I can certainly practise the manuals and bunny hops - so I will be!

the same points so that they hit home with us.

I was going to be riding alone so
couldn't really be bothered with driving anywhere - that left me with Boars Hill. It was pretty bone
dry and really fast. Not a very demanding route and a fair bit on road but a couple of short, steep climbs and
one descent that's actually pretty good. It's just off the main path and is actually pretty technical and hard
to go fast on. There are also some impressively massive houses up the top of boars hill and as I passed one there
were 2 Ferrari's waiting to pull out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managed about 20km and took just over an hour, pretty fun little ride and ideal for after work! This was also
the first ride in aaaages where I've taken no bag so no tools, no water etc... Felt quite nice not having
the bag on my back!&lt;/p&gt;

Obviously, this means
that I had to do a ride; question being did I go out on the roadie or the MTB. In the end I decided to do road today and
head out on the MTB tomorrow. I very nearly just sat on the turbo but decided to actually put the turbo away along with the turbo
tyre! Might be a bit optimistic but got to hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set out with no aim of where to go or how long/far but knew that I'd follow the road down through appleton and just keep on that
as it's pretty nice and quiet. I wound up riding to a little past Pusey, about 48km in total there and back. Lovely ride and I'm pretty happy
with the average speed too. Quite glad to be back outside not on the turbo even if it does mean dealing with cars!&lt;/p&gt;

Last night I got a handful of texts from him saying that he'd
locked himself out of his room and then another this morning saying that he was still locked out and not going to make it.
I suggested to George that we headed out for a ride in the afternoon and he agreed, I didn't fancy the full 40k of the
Christmas Common ride so chose the 30k Nettlebed ride. The guide suggested that this route holds up pretty well in the wet so it sounded
fairly ideal. We headed over at about lunch time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got there, got out of the car and it was bloody cold! We set off and pretty quickly picked up an offroad trail. The first half of the loop
was pretty great, there we lots of fast descent although not too techy but with little bits to try jump off etc... It was also almost all off-road
which was pretty nice. About 1/4 of the way in we bumped into a lady who flagged us down to help work out where we were. Turns out that she'd walked
a lot further than she thought and kept saying that she always walks too far and doesn't realise how far she's gone! We helped her work out where she was
and then continued on our way. At this point we did another fast descent that was also really quite long. This dropped us into Henley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rode through Henley and picked up a trail the other side, this is where it started getting really muddy. This bit of trail was a quick downhill
followed by 2km of uphill, not very steep and should have been simple. But no, it was majorly churned up and muddy. In quite a few areas we just gave up
and walked. We also stopped here for a spot of lunch next to this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Boundary marker" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HcijLqlJ3wY/UTzrMBbDa4I/AAAAAAAABpI/kSQRjMC8Sn4/s640/IMG_20130310_155115.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked the map and it seemed that the second half of the ride was to be uphill, it wasn't wrong. It was also pretty muddy most of the way.
Although, we did go through a pretty flat wood that would be good fun in the dry. We managed to hit the last bit of road and go the wrong way, 
I misread the map so we wound up heading away from Nettlebed, not toward. Due to this and it starting to get a bit dark we skipped the last bit of 
offroad and just followed the road all the way back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all a good ride, pretty good fun and should be pretty awesome in the dry! Since starting injecting meds I'm finding hills to be a major 
issue, there's just nothing in my legs. I'm hoping that I can just ride through it! We wound up doing 30km so not a bad effort. I'm also really enjoying
the bike, it just feels great and really inspires me to want to have fun on it.&lt;/p&gt;

He's part of a riding group who ride areas around Oxford, he passed me onto another guy called Ainsley. They
had a ride planned for Tuesday riding in the Chilterns starting from Watlington, only downside being that they
were starting at 6pm. It's about 18 miles away but involves going on the Oxford ring road - to be there for 6
that also meant going during rush hour. No matter I said that I'd be and started work early so that I could leave
the house at about 5.15pm, I got a bit lose in Watlington trying to find the car park so got there about 6.05. Turned
out that there were only 3 of us; Ainsley, Matt and myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did introductions, setup bikes and headed out. To begin with we had a fairly long, decent gradient climb. This had
me suffering, it takes me a good while to get warmed and this just wasn't the ideal way to do it! I had to take a couple of
stops on the way up but wound up at the top, not too long a climb really. There weren't any really bad climbs on the ride, there were a few 
really muddy bits but not too many although the ground in places was quite draggy anyway. We did a couple of pretty cracking, fun descents. Nothing
technical this time but i'm assured that there is plenty of steep, technical stuff in the area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the ride there was a small set of steps that I managed to totally OTB down, I started without any run in and there was a bit
of a depression before the wooden holdy bit in the step so I wound up doing my best superman impression.
After that were a couple of steep little ladder things that were pretty good fun though. About a mile before the end my light just completely
cut out with now warning which wasn't so good so I need to investigate if there's a loose connection or something. I think that I'll also
buy a spare battery pack as they're so cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all a really fun ride and I'm really glad that I got out there, hoping for more rides
with these guys to come!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="bikes"></category><category term="riding"></category><category term="chilterns"></category></entry><entry><title>Ben's Aber Weekend</title><link href="http://chvck.co.uk/posts/2013/Jan/13/bens-aber-weekend/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>chuck</name></author><id>tag:chvck.co.uk,2013-01-13:posts/2013/Jan/13/bens-aber-weekend/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last Monday was Ben's birthday so he organised a trip to Aberystwyth with plenty of riding involved. Plan being to ride
Nant-y-arian on Saturday and then something suitable to hangover states on Sunday. I went to Rich's house on Friday night
as Saturday morning was to be an early start. At Rich's we did a night ride in the Lickey Hills which were muddy but good
fun. I started out with my light attached to my helmet but it pretty quickly became evident that the level of fog around was
not ideal for a helmet light so switched it over to my bars which was much better. The light is a tad spotty but is generally
really good and there was plenty of light for me to see by. Definitely going to have to ride those trails in the dry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday, we made our way to Ben's, loaded up his van and set off to nant. We were running late but that was OK as the other
guys were running later (expect the other Ben who, as always, was punctual). There were Ben, Ben, Rich, Taylor, Rab, Jase,
Pete and myself. I'd never met Pete before but had been to the alps with Rab and Jase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Vans" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-o-AjCano134/UPchd6ToroI/AAAAAAAABbo/fpMKYJj1GjA/s640/IMG_20130112_115846.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, once we'd sorted ourselves out
we set out on a Summit + extras loop. The extras we threw in were White Fridge and a few did Reaper, I went off in hunt of another
track that I've done before but wound up riding down a steep, rocky track until I bumped into Zorro and did the bottom half of that.
Nant was, as always, a blast and I felt pretty good, although slow, on the climbs too. As a first I also took a hip flask on the
ride, filled with port. Why had I never done that before?! It was a great idea!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Sending it" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/734841_10151624410798765_255312670_n.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed to the Tiddly Widdly for a pint before going to aber and at this point said bye to Ben and Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pint" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/309668_10151624416393765_1474277726_n.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we got back and got the keys to our rooms in Maes y mor we showered etc... and set off to Lopburi for food. Lopburi was
good as per usual, I had the jungle curry - tasty. After that we headed to spoons for coffeebucas. That was a bit of a warning
sign that it was going to be a bit of a drunken night. We hit several pubs before venturing into pier pressure. That place
has not improved although it has got stickier. I'm pretty sure that it hasn't changed since we were at uni, even the drinks are the
same - just more expensive. At about 2 Jase, Rab and Pete headed off; I decided to stay with Rich and Ben but I quickly decided
to leave too. Unfortunately it was midway back to the guest house that I realised Rich had the key and my phone was dead, no matter
I just went for a short walk and then sat against a wall for a while - it was quite warm out. We'll certainly be using Maes y mor again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday, we all woke up quite late and after paying for the rooms and having breakfast we managed to get into the vans about 12ish.
We headed up to nant again but this time parked up near white fridge so that we could go out the top and do some of the conti
loop and up into anglers retreat. I felt much better climbing than on Saturday, not really sure why - possibly the lack of
drinking port on the ride. We went out on a normal conti loop but cut out the loop to the reservoir and back as we'd do the good
descent there later on. We stopped 3/4 down Bont Goch and did the descent there, it was pretty wildly cut up and fairly
hard to predict what was coming up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bont goch" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/226670_10151624428393765_1109049718_n.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that was the long old climb that goes on and on! We did the techy climb followed by descending
the slab which was ace. After that we headed back to the conti loop and rode it backward to get back to nant. We chose to skip
hippity hop in favour of doing white fridge whilst there was still light. It was a fantastic ride although majorly cold. I also
made the choice of going through every water obstacle - that didn't make it any warmer and several times I was in upto my axles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that was home time, 4 hours back to Aberystwyth! It was a great weekend and I'm looking forward to the Dyfi warmup for
more!&lt;/p&gt;

That is seriously way too long to spend off the bike. This weekend Rich came over to Oxford to hang out
and we decided to ride somewhere. I still don't know much riding in the Oxford area but figured that
the Ridgeway was probably a decent bet for a bit of a pootle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bikes out and ready to go. Sun shining, no rain, small amount of wind, ideal. Off we went. Within about 50 metres
we discovered the general theme of the ride - MUD. So much mud. Oh and deep puddles with ice still in them, they were nice
too. We decided to ride both sides of the car and all in all it was a good day out, we did about 25km in about 3 hours,
so not exactly blistering pace but the mud was pretty much everywhere and fairly similar in characteristics to super glue.
The area of the Ridgeway itself that we rode was pretty flat, rolling hills is the phrase; I suppose. I'm hoping
to get back up there sometime soon but, ideally, when it's a bit drier! Come Summer I think that it'll be good fun
up there - it'll be very, very fast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, first ride in about 2 months and my legs were really hurting by the end. Despite a lack of hills I think that
the mud had a similar effect on my legs that hills do. Not ideal condition but nice to get out on the bike
and it was a nice day with some nice views!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="bikes"></category><category term="riding"></category><category term="ridgeway"></category></entry><entry><title>Coed-y-brenin Enduro 2012</title><link href="http://chvck.co.uk/posts/2012/Oct/13/coed-y-brenin-enduro-2012/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-10-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>chuck</name></author><id>tag:chvck.co.uk,2012-10-13:posts/2012/Oct/13/coed-y-brenin-enduro-2012/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, Friday I hitched a lift up to Coedy with Jimbo and Richard (who I hadn't met before) to meet up with Ben,
Jimbo and Richard were staying in a nearby B&amp;amp;B but I opted for the cheaper option of Bens van. The drive up went well
and traffic was good, once in Dolgellau Ben and I grabbed some food at a pub which was also pretty good! We headed
 back to the campsite and it was pretty dead so we just grabbed a couple of beers before heading to sleep. 
The night in Bens van was pretty cold but all things equal was fairly comfortable. By the time we got up cars were
slowly arriving and by 10 the place was packed. Race plates fitted, breakfast eaten, bikes put together, riding time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone gathered for the race briefing and there was about 250 of us in total. Briefing over and off we went,
Ben and I had decided to stick together and take it easy, Jimbo went roaring off ahead of us. We rode with some of
the abermtb guys for quite a while during various sections too. The climbs were often long but just fire roads so
just grinding up wasn't so bad, although by the end they were making me feel pain somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good - some of the off piste descents were truely cracking, steep and due to it being wet very muddy. Really,
really good fun those were, some flowly singletrack too. Everyone on the day were really nice and most people pulled
 over to let us pass on the descents. We ended up bumping into 3 guys from Birmingham quite a bit and they were an
excellent laugh, could hear them a mile off! Unfortunately I did go OTB in front of them which was a tad
embarrassing but nothing was hurt bar my pride. Some of the actual trail centre descents were also pretty good fun,
 what i believe is the final descent on the trail centre of the road was a hoot. Also, the food station was cracking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad - To be fair at the time I thought that there was a lot of bad but realistically not that much sticks in my
mind. There was a section that was a long old climb through fields and really bad muddy wooded bits. In all fairness
to the course designers the rain didn't help and from what I've heard they couldn't link everything up without it. We
 had a brief chat with some marshalls and they said that not even the top guys managed to ride the wet grass bits.
Other than that bit not a lot sticks in my mind as being bad except...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ugly - After the final descent of the trail centre side of the road we crossed over to the Tarw side. This I did
not enjoy, by this point I was pretty tired and just wanted to finish, what actually happened was another 15km or so
of riding round the Tarw trail with a few big old fireroad climbs. The descents were roughy and rocky so were hard
work as I was already pretty knackered. Had I been less tired I think that the descents would have actually been
cracking. Also worth going in the ugly is that Ben had 4 punctures, he used up not only all his spare tubes but mine
too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I really do not know if I'll do it again, at the time had you asked me then I most certainly would have said
 no but I'm not sure. I think that next year I really need to work on my fitness as that would go a long way to
helping enjoy it. It was much, much harder than the Dyfi enduro which I had not expected. End of the day though it
was a day riding bikes in Wales so can't be that bad!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Position - 254th out of 269 overall, 134th out of 140 in category, Duration 7hr 46min 29sec. All you can do is laugh!&lt;/p&gt;

This trip had been in the pipeline for a fair few months
and I was looking forward to it. We were due to fly out on Saturday 4th.
George had kindly agreed to drive us to and from Heathrow on the Saturday in his parents' estate.
Ben and Taylor arrived at my place on the Friday night to get bikes sorted and generally get ready for
packing in the morning and getting to the airport. About 10 minutes after arriving Ben
realised that he'd forgotten his passport... he wasn't best pleased about that. He went home
to get it (2 hours to get here and then straight back again!) and decided to come back in the morning
after sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, all kit ready to go and car packing time. So, 3 bikes in bike bags don't fit
in a Mondeo estate. Problem. In the end we managed to squeeze everything in by taking Taylors
bike out of the bag and playing quite a bit of bike tetris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bike tetris" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/559242_10151343880853765_1697281874_n.jpg" /&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;T'was a bit of a squeeze...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all that faff was done and dusted
we actually managed to get to the airport with plently of time to spare. We checked in etc... and didn't
get charged for the bikes which was nice! A pint and something to eat later and it was boarding time.
We flew with Swiss air and during the flight we got given ice cream and Swiss chocolate, pretty good.
Other than the ice cream and chocolate the flight was a flight. We collected baggage and did all that jazz
before meeting up with the other three guys we were there with - Jase, Rab and NC. I hadn't met
these guys before and they were sound. Transfer from Geneva to Morzine and we arrived at the chalet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The chalet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I feel that I should mention that we were catered for. The chalet was massive,
big enough to hold 26 (I think it was). Upon arriving we met Paul, the chalet manager/chef and he
told us that it was just us and 3 other guys for the whole week. Oh, there was also a hot tub, that's
worth a mention. We unpacked all our stuff and sat down for our first meal of the week. Well,
the food was excellent and stayed that way for the duration of our stay. First night there so we
went out for a few in Morzine, it was fairly quiet but we had a pretty good night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday, rain, lots of. Slightly hungover and not a good forecast for the day we decided to hold
off on starting the riding for a day, no point in buying a lift pass to find the lifts shut for most
of the day due to storms. Instead we wandered into town for a bite to eat and to get our bearings.
After we'd eaten we had a bit of a wander round and during this time some form of street procession
started up, it was really pretty random. It was mostly vans and large vehicles covered in trees and
tarps etc... To mind I remember there being 101 dalmations - kids on skates being caught by a bloke who put
them into the back of a van. Loads of classic rally cars and a dragon. Yes, a dragon. It was a tractor with
a grab on the front that was covered in a tarp (no, the driver could not see where he was going), the grab meant that
they could move the dragons head which was actually pretty cool! Anyway, that excitement over we bought some beers
and headed back to the chalet where we just chilled out for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Randomness" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/599463_10151343885143765_1970476067_n.jpg" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday, bikes. We rolled out of the chalet about mid morning and decided to hit up the
Pleney. We bought our lift passes (93 euros for 6 consecutive days I think) and made our
way up to the top via chair lift. Chair lifts are utterly awesome. First run in we
decided to take the blue run just to ease us in. It was fairly bumpy, pretty steep in places and
fairly slick. I think that it's safe to say that we were all a little bit worried about how hard
other tracks would be if this was a blue. It wasn't a blue, it was a black. Taylor had somehow managed
to take us down the wrong one, oh well - at least we felt better that it was black!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The crew" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/400420_10151343887973765_860735645_n.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The crew for the week, except Ben&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Second time lucky" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/394464_10151343888863765_1050098128_n.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Second time lucky&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up we did the blue. This was mostly double tracky fireroad type stuff and was seriously bumpy, braking bumps
were a recurring theme for the week and were not fun on my hardtail. It was a pretty boring track really.
Next up we tried the other black track, this was a good'un! It had steep bits and was twisty and drops and
was fun! It wasn't full of braking bumps as bad as other tracks for some reason and was one of
my favourites of the entire trip, certainly my favourite in the Les Gets &amp;amp; Morzine areas! It also
had a short section called 10% which was just a steep run into a berm or 2, I really thought that I was going to
lose a wheel in the braking bumps going down that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point we stopped for some food and a drink and decided to head over to Les Gets. We rode the linking
section from Morzine and popped out at the top of the bottom section of the Les Gets red line main run.
It started out with a few jumps and then worked it's way down through loads of berms. Pretty fun. By this point
it'd started raining again and the chair lift up to the top was not fun, wet and windy. We pretty swiftly headed
on down the main line. It was jumpy, bermy and wide. Oh, and FULL of braking bumps. Not just a few around corners
and what not but a constant stream of small bumps with a few big ones thrown in for good measure. It was really, really
hard work on the hardtail, gave me a pounding and was difficult to keep up any speed. None-the-less a pretty
fun track that would be a great laugh without the braking bumps! At the bottom of this we were all utterly plastered
in mud, most of us had given up with goggles due to them instantly getting covered. A couple of the guys
were only wearing XC jerseys on their upper half and were getting pretty cold so we decided to call it a day
and ride back along the road to Morzine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cold chairlifts" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/418479_10151343890173765_438921370_n.jpg" /&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;No shortage of mud&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow Ben and I got left for dead going down the road (suspect super tacky
tyres had something to do with it) and we decided to throw in an extra run of the fun black line down Pleney. I really
did like that track! After that it was home for showers, hot tub, food and chilling out. Rab, Jase and NC also managed
to spend 3 hours in the hot tub!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Winding down" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/557328_10151343892203765_1210675953_n.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Proper way to wind down!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, dry! Tuesday we decided to head straight over to Les Gets and explore the area a bit more. We got there
and did the main line to warm up, it had dried up a bit and was even bumpier than I remember, didn't hugely enjoy it.
After that run we headed over to the jump park and did a couple of runs over there, they were mostly just berm after berm and
ridiculously bumpy, not ideal for me! A bite to eat and we headed back to the main Les Gets lift to
check out the canyon run. At this point Ben and I also swapped bikes. Wow, the top of the main line was suddenly a lot
more fun! DH bike just took out most of the buzz of the smaller bumps, it was great. We did the top and headed over to the canyon.
This trail was also great, it was rooty, steep in bits, small drops and fairly tight (as the name suggests). There was
another track that ran down with the canyon but jumped across it back and forth, we gave that one a miss! After that track
we decided to try out the other side of Les Gets, this only really had 1 track. It was a good track that was pretty easy
but fast and steep. Oh, and full of braking bumps (getting the theme yet?) but it was still good even though
my arms did die at the bottom each time. We did that a couple of times before calling it day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul had said that most of the guides and chalet guys etc... had Wednesdays off so we decided to head into town
for a few drinks again. It was even quieter than Saturday! We had a few drinks and then Rab, Jase and NC headed back,
I decided to stay with Ben and Taylor but to switch to energy drinks as I didn't fancy getting battered. We had a couple of
drinks before deciding to try Opera which seemed to be the main club, not only was that utterly, utterly dead but also
10 euros for a shot or bottle of beer. We gave up without having a drink there and headed home!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, rest. Taylor, Ben and I decided to have a day off and just chill out. Not much happened. The other guys went up
Super Morzine and said that sections were some of the steepest stuff that theyve ever ridden, that made it high on my agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday, disaster. We decided to head up the Super Morzine and then explore over the other side of the mountain and maybe head
to Chatel. The top of Super Morzine is a separate chair lift so you can lap it, we decided that we'd do a single lap of it
before heading further afield. One lap done and I realised that my forks had broken, I had no travel and they were just clunking up and
down. That was that for me, I headed down on the road and headed for the Scott shop which Paul had recommended to us. As chance would
have it Paul was getting ready to go for a ride there and gave me the name of a mechanic at a different shop to
go and have a chat to. Unfortunately he wasn't there so I headed to the chalet and set about fixing the forks. After a lot
of swearing and effort I got the air unit apart (most stupid, stupid system ever). It all looked OK until I realised that
the positive air piston wasn't attached to the rod, it'd blown off - blowing a circlip off in the process. Simple to fix at least,
I put it all back together and too kthe chance to remove the spacer and make them 160mm again. That took me the best part of the
day so I just chilled out until the others returned. Had a bit of a chat about where they'd been and it sounded pretty ace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday, disaster again. Exact same as Thursay, top of Super Morzine I lost all travel. Not happy. Headed into town
and headed straight for the shop Paul had suggested to talk to the mechanic, as luck would have it he was in. His
opinion was that the rod was damaged (I was pretty sure it wasn't) or that the circlip was on upside down. Wait, what?
Yeah, so turns out that circlips aren't all symmetrical and that they have a rounded and a flat edge, flat edge takes the load.
Learn something new every day! Back to the chalet and repaired forks again, by the time I'd finished it was getting on and I'd
lost confidence in the fork so I just chilled out again with the aim of getting a hire bike for Saturday. I asked Paul where
to hire one from and he told me to use his bike (Iron Horse DH bike). Brilliant! What a legend! The other guys
had been over the same as Thursday and had a pretty good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday, aaaaace! We headed straight over to Les Linderettes which the guys had said was good. It really was. Having a downhill
bike made so much difference, the braking bumps were still noticeable but the ability to just plough through them at speed
and not lose all control and speed really made the difference. We mostly rode 2 tracks over there, one of which was the
old French national - this was one of my favourite tracks - it was fast with a bit of tech thrown in. We also headed up
the Marmotte on the chair lift, that was a long old lift. Once up there we had a choice of black or red descents, the black seemed
to take us down the wrong side of the mountain so we went for the red. It wasn't amazing, it started out really pedally and then got
a bit more fun although quite wide. Ideal for a hardtail ironically. We spent a good portion of the day riding Les Linderettes before
riding back to Morzine via a goat village (I kid ye not) and a nice lake to swim in for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Top of Marmotte" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/526093_10151343906378765_1915620457_n.jpg" /&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Lake!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday, home :(. Nuff said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a great holiday, big thanks to Paul for that. Next time I won't be taking a hardtail, it's just not the tool for the job
out there for this sort of riding. Next time I think that we're thinking of going somewhere more off the beaten track
too and making more of a road trip out of it, should be ace! Now, to find a full sus frame....&lt;/p&gt;

So I decided that for
old times sake a ride out was in order, no real plan - just ride up to nant and do whatever. Ben H asked if
he could tag along too, he didn't quite realise that i was going for a bit of a long one at the time though!
Anyway, Sunday morning rolled round and Ben arrive around 10.30, we waited for the episode of True Blood (yeah, I know)
I was watching to finish and then headed out, the weather was good - cloudy but not wet and it was a nice temperature too.
I had organised my thoughts into which way to get up to Nant so we headed out on the A44 until the road that
leads off and climbs up to the Waunfawr - Capel Dewi road. We went along that and continued to Capel Dewi before heading on
up to Nant through Banc-y-darren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once up Nant we headed down Zorro and played the no pedal game, always a fun one! Once down we had a spot of lunch
before heading up the leg burner. About halfway up we came across the landslide that I'd heard about. Wow, wasn't expecting
that much damage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Landslide" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oNy9qYlbf_s/T-d7UKs9mUI/AAAAAAAABJU/Nfdd44AeV0Y/s400/IMG_20120624_122237.jpg" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not even sure that stream was there before and if it was then it certainly wasn't as open as it is now. Pretty
incredible what water can do! Once we'd finished marvelling at the landslide we carried on up and over to Hippity Hop then
Drunken Druid. At this point we turned off and went through the gate to do a rather rocky descent that I hadn't done in
a while. Wow, water had taken its toll here too, some bits were more like riding trials than a descent - it was
pretty wild! At this point I decided that we'd head out on Joe's Back Garden and hit an obstacle...a stream that
was just a little higher than normal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Stream" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Z-PRCQSdk7Y/T-d7pNCTuOI/AAAAAAAABJk/ZbbVt_ZMLzo/s400/IMG_20120624_132029.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Stream" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-BQadexuNr3E/T-d8U3omc3I/AAAAAAAABKg/ix6x9qiDRbY/s400/IMG_20120624_132036.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found a place to leap over and continued out along the stream bed which actually had a stream in it and was rather rutted
and rocky. Once on the road we went over to the resevoir and over the dam before going round to link back up with the
Conti trail and continued along that. The puddles on the inward part from the resevoir were ridiculously high and the mx-ers
have made a right mess of the banks going around them. The first descent on that part is also rather wild now and really good fun!
The Bont Goch climb hasn't recovered since the last time I went up there and is still very scarred from the water with a fairly
decent sized stream running down it in a massive rut! Once up the top of the climb we took the bridleway down instead
of the Bont Goch descent, just for something a bit different!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued along the road and then followed the Conti loop back to nant. By the time we popped out up the top
of Hippity Hop we were both feeling the distance in our legs and decided to do Hippity Hop and then head back home via White Fridge.
At the bottom of White Fridge I decided to take my rear brake pads out to have a look at why they were making such an odd noise. Yeah,
no pad left and rubbing metal on metal, that old one! Unfortunately the spring was also utterly dead and so I couldn't fit the pads
back in, luckily the only downhill we had left was on the road so a front brake only would suffice. We descended down to
Penrhyncoch before climbing back up to Capel Dewi along the little back road, Ben was off and pushing this point and I was
feeling knackered! Neither of us fancied climbing up the Capel Dewi to Waunfawr road so we decided to return via the roundabout just
out of town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all a nice ride with good weather. Certainly a great ride to remember the area by with some great views. Going
to miss these hills!&lt;/p&gt;

some different bits to get the distance up. The basic difference was to be that we'd kick out further on the way out
by going further along the
Conti loop doing most of the Bont Goch descent before doubling back on the rocky descent and then doing the long
slog of a climb up to Anglers. Then on the way back we'd climb up to the Bont Goch descent again but take the bridleway
down and then come back to Nant along the usual Conti Loop and do a Summit loop too. Oh, we also parked in the forestry
car park outside of nant so that would add a reasonable amount of distance too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the days running up to this were wet to say the least. Friday saw the beginning of flooding in the area but Saturday was
due to be sunny all day. The morning came round and it was wet but the rain had stopped. &lt;a href="http://www.cambrian-news.co.uk/news/i/24955/"&gt;A quick look online showed
massive flooding in the area&lt;/a&gt; but we decided to go out anyway and
got to the forestry car park at about 10.30. It wasn't exactly nice out and getting out of the van I stepped into a stream that
had never been there before! I wasn't feeling stoked at this point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Me not looking best impressed" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Ksi_Wky28HI/T9SHag6SJsI/AAAAAAAAAvo/gmpIkUKcPOA/s640/P1010171.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We trundled over toward Nant and got to the bottom of the Pendam climb that pops us up near the base of Hippity Hop.
Wow! There was an unreal amount of water flowing down the track and the stream nearby was completely white and very
rapid. Climbing up this bit of the climb there was a constant rut that went to about 3 foot deep in places - utterly, utterly
crazy. The photo below shows the water streaming down the track, never seen it like that before. We thought that this was
a lot of water, little did we know...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Water!" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NGZ2TjGFNCA/T9SHdooujlI/AAAAAAAAAv4/98JSw5wcPhg/s640/P1010172.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward we went and kicked out onto the Conti trail, as soon as we came across the first lake we noticed that it was ridiculously high
with water everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-c_iRkvSdqR8/T9SHbt94nOI/AAAAAAAAAvs/TMSkWi8cDgk/s640/P1010173.jpg" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point a Forestry Commission 4x4 came along and we had a brief chat with the guy who told us that
Nant-y-moch resevoir had received 10 inches of water the previous day and that they were struggling to stop
the dam from overflowing! The epicness of this ride was rising pretty rapidly! Onward we went until we hit the first
bit of a river crossing which has a bridge. The path to the bridge itself was flooded and we had to find a bit of an alternate line
to it but the path away from the bridge was flooded in all directions and we had to jump the fence and trudge through
a bit of shallow bog to get back to the path. Unreal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GADXEstLmPM/T9SHimAAlGI/AAAAAAAAAwE/RoEL8L_jVyQ/s512/P1010176.jpg" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided that we'd continue on the route that I had planned which cut off the Conti trail at this point onto a bit
of track that I'd done before with the Ystwyth guys, a fair amount of this track was now a stream but rideable! We continued on
and did the ridiculous grass descent down to the resevoir where the Conti loop joins. Ben managed to hit a tuft of grass and have
a bit of a comical off too. Back on the Conti trail we rode the bit that leads to the resevoir backward and we'd then cross another
stream and cut down to where one of the Conti trails descends to from the resevoir (we'd do this descent later). First major issue of the day!
As we approached the stream we could see a group of motocrossers stood about and as we passed them one was walking back toward us. His sole comment
was "Good luck with that", I didn't think much of it and figured that we'd find a way across. Uh, no. The stream was way, way
too high to get across and despite back tracking down the river for a while we couldn't find anywhere to cross. We bikehiked back across directly to the trail
that we'd just come along and rode back along it and started following the Conti trail the correct way again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was expecting the puddles in this section to be quite bad but they looked deep enough that we decided to skirt around
the sides of all of them. We hit the descent and it was pretty wild, streams running down it everywhere and big rocks all over
the place. Just as we got to toward the end we overtook 2 of the motocrossers we'd seen earlier, putting us down a really crap line
with a lot of water running down it and some big, sketchy looking rocks. No matter we made it down fine. At this point
we had to wait aaaages for the motocrossers to get up the start of the climb to the Bont Goch descent, they were taking forever. In the end
we just gave up and passed them, not often you overtake crossers going uphill!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Ij4ocpbrBOo/T9SH1Squ_sI/AAAAAAAAAxE/s8gPppyNhBQ/s640/P1010182.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bont Goch descent itself was really, really hard work with a stream running down it and massive rocks all over the place. Most of
the previous lines that i knew were totally gone. The rocky descent just off the Bont Goch descent was just as bad with line choice being
pretty key to not either going down a hole or smacking into a big rock. We got down unscathed and started on the long climb
up to Anglers Retreat, the start of this road was underwater too (below) but the actual fireroad was fine and there was
even a bit of sun starting to show! At the top of this climb there's usually a stream crossing followed by a short, sharp technical
climb. We had a brief discussion and decided that the stream crossing would likely be uncrossable so skirted around that section
on the road...into the wind which was really starting to pick up now! We continued on up the fireroad to the start of the next descent which
actually started off fairly dry but I felt that sudden feeling that the rear of the bike felt dead. Rear tyre totally flat.
Quick swapping of tubes and we were off again, following the standard set so far this descent was also soaking but most of the lines had stayed intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bi2Cmcapn3I/T9SH8NzscaI/AAAAAAAAAxQ/DK_Whwk2gsU/s512/P1010184.jpg" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up was the bit that links Anglers to the Mach 3, I'd only done this once before but we picked it up easily enough and
skirted around a couple of puddles before hitting a stream crossing. This was completely and utterly unpassable. It was very deep
and looked really fast. Quick look at the OS map and we decided to head back up to the start of the previous descent and pick up
a fireroad there. Once we got to the point that marks the start of that previous descent we stopped for a bit of lunch and
decided that we'd head back to Nant as we didn't know if we'd actually be able to get to Mach and it was getting to be fairly late
already. The usual way back has a deep crossing that we decided wouldn't be a good idea so we picked up the road and headed back that way
before picking up the Conti loop backward again and riding the same bit of trail for the third time! What really struck
us at this point was that the water level had gone down loads. We actually make it across the afore-mentioned bridge with
no problems and even the lake had gone down a fair bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-VdbnhOPkjj8/T9SINyROoLI/AAAAAAAAAyA/B4pb8G65qwM/s640/P1010189.jpg" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once back at Nant we picked up the Summit loop and did Hippity Hop, Drunken Druid and High as a Kite before a brief break at the visitors
centre. We left off from there and headed up to the Italian Job and saw a sign stating that the Summit trail was closed due to a landslide,
this we later learnt was on the leg burner, a section had collapsed. We had no intentions of going down toward the bottom end of the
trail anyway so pushed on and did Italian Job and Hippity Hop. All of the Summit trails that we did were running fine and felt good
as usual. We did the really eroded climb from earlier backward which was pretty wild in bits and continued on to and did the top
of White Fridge which was also ace before heading back to the van.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ace ride that despite not getting us either Mach and back or 100km was great fun, a bit of an adventure and 60km! Thanks
to Ben for the photos.&lt;/p&gt;

It's worth mentioning at this point that Ben and I did a 50 mile road loop up to, around and back
from Lake Vyrnwy. It was pretty nice but the SPDs caused a lot of pain behind my right knee which was
still very sore today. Anyway, earlier in the week I looked at the length of Eastridge XC loop and it
turned out to be 8km, rather short and probably a 2 lap job!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We turned up to the carpark and waited about an hour for Bean, standard really. The loop took
us 2 hours! 8km took us 2 hours! This was a mixture of my leg hurting a lot and Bean taking
ages to repair his snapped chain, this was Ok though there was a little double just next to
where he snapped it so I played on that trying to clear it for a while, managed it in the end!
The Eastridge XC loop is pretty damn good, OK it is short BUT it's pretty much all singletrack with
no fireroad so it's pretty demanding and definitely not an easy course. Really, really good fun though and
will certainly be going back there, hopefully next time we'll get in 2 loops and there are also the old DH tracks so
plently of stuff to play about on too.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="eastridge"></category><category term="bikes"></category><category term="riding"></category></entry><entry><title>Clarach Shred</title><link href="http://chvck.co.uk/posts/2012/May/07/clarach-shred/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-07T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>chuck</name></author><id>tag:chvck.co.uk,2012-05-07:posts/2012/May/07/clarach-shred/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dyfi enduro was yesterday so Ben and I decided that a bit of downhilling was in order,
had enough of riding uphill. We took the morning fairly easy and chilled before heading over
at around lunch time. We started out by hitting the top of the main line a couple of times, neither
of us really in the mood for a full push back up. It was riding fast and fun. We decided to try the new line
that the freshers have built as neither of us had ridden the full thing. Fair play to them, really, really
fun blast of a track. Nothing too technical but fast and jumpy. Since I had last ridden it they'd
added 2 massive berms and a big jump in at the bottom. The berms are big and ace to ride, the jump on the other hand
just isn't quite right. The takeoff is somewhat steep and short and the landing is tiny and too close! Every time
we hit it we were overshooting the landing to uphill which isn't all that great on a hardtail I can tell you!
But all in all they've done a good job, there are a couple of tricky bits that are slippery and off camber, I also managed
to have a bit of a stack trying to ride out a really cheeky bit of a line!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also hit up the top of the wall ride track and spent ages working down a couple of the tracks taking photos
and generally messing about. Rad shred and great way to finish off the 3 day weekend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few photos from the day:&lt;/p&gt;

A couple of the old abermtb group were coming
back for this and it was shipping up to be a good weekend of riding. Ben was, as usual, staying with
me and we arranged to meet Joe, Stu, Paul and Andy over at Capel Dewi at 11 for a bit of downhill
before heading to Nant-y-arian at 2. Before setting out in the morning Ben and I had the simple,
single, task of changing my brakes pads. As is always the way, this was not a simple task.
The brake pads themselves took a lot of convincing to get in and even after letting some oil
out of the system there was no way the rotor was going in! After much wasted time, I remembered that
I had a partially worn set of contaminated pads. With a bit of convincing we got the rotor to go in
with these pads fitted. However, we had cunningly managed to let air into the system so we pissed about
bleeding the brake for a while till we had a fantastic lever but a rear wheel that didn't spin freely!
We figured it'd do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En-route to Capel Dewi (running late) I received a fun phone call from my Dad informing me
that I'd been caught speeding when I went down to Oxford. This was shaping up to be a bit
of a crap day. I couldn't get my head in the game at Capel Dewi but we hit up a few runs
and I still had fun. The ride up Nant-y-arian went much better! We met up with a group of
Paul's mates from Norwich in the carpark and set out. The trails were riding really nice
and the climbs felt pretty good, we even snuck in secret Zorro. Such a fun descent featuring
drops, singletrack, scree slopes, jumps, all in all pretty rad! First ride in a while where I
came bvack totally dry too, always good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bright and early Sunday morning we headed for Machynlleth to park up and sign on for the event.
Race plates fitted (701 here) and bikes ready to go we (Ben and I) joined the ever growing queue of riders
and their bikes waiting for the starting gates to open. After a bit of a light hearted briefing
the gates opened and the riders were off. After the usual stop and starting we managed to get through the gates
5-10 minutes later! Letting off 7-800 riders in one go through a small gateway is never going to be a smooth flow
really! We hit the road and Ben had already managed to get ahead of me so I rode as quickly as
I could along the road overtaking people where I could and being overtaken plenty too. After a few miles
we hit the first offroad climb, I knew that there was no way I'd be catching Ben now so I decided to
just sit back and enjoy myself and ride at my own pace to try see how quickly I could get round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MOQ9DQ352sw/T6mm5lsOHDI/AAAAAAAAAr0/0dfh0Zb0H9Q/w464-h348-k/P1010117.JPG" /&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: small; text-align: center;"&gt;Riders waiting for the gates to open&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first climb was a long slog of a fire road but I knew that it was coming and paced myself
to sit and spin away, think I even managed to overtake more than I was overtaken! Managed to have a brief chat
with Dave Reed before he raced off ahead. Just before the
top the climb switches back on itself in a big open corner, they usually have a band here but this
time round they had a harp being played - pretty cool! At the top of the climb saw a group of cheerleaders
urging us on, I was contemplating stopping for a rest but decided to push on to try get to
the top of the first descent as quickly as possible to try get a clear run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top of Elephant I was ready to go and even though I was following someone we were going
quick enough for me to hit the first kicker. Unfortunately overtaking opportunities were pretty
scarse on this descent as it's rather narrow. Before even reaching the first corner we somehow
found ourselves queueing up stationary. Still not sure why but eventually we started moving again,
we hit the first corner and the guy in front of my looked somewhat out of his depth and managed to fall off!
I quickly checked he was OK and then set off again before getting stuck behind someone else. No matter,
got the end of the descent and prepared myself for climbing for quite some time. The course took us fairly directly up to the
field climb where the uphill gets a bit more technical. For some reason my camelbak resevoir was refusing to
let me drink anything so by this point I was getting a bit parched having not drank anything since before we started. I made it most of
the way over the field before stopping and draining half of my water bottle. I then hit the really steep bit of the climb and
just as i hit the top I heard a familiar voice and Andy and Stu appeared. Despite them both saying they'd be really
unfit and slow they must have been going pretty quickly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to try to stick with them and following them down the descents was rather good although Andy is
still somewhat reckless and made some rather interesting overtakes. The descents were all running nicely
and plenty of overtaking was on the cards. I lost them at the new technical climb, I was off and pushing, as
was everyone around me - not a fun climb really. The next time that I saw them was at the bottom of the World Cup descent which was, as always, utterly
rad. The big dipper before it was quite entertaining with some massive puddles and plenty of people complaining, I
managed to ride through the middle of the lot (well, walked one after stopping in the middle). Between big dipper and World Cup
is a small climb through some trees, as I rode into the trees I could hear the iconic Star Wars music getting louder and louder.
I rounded a corner and there it was, a group of people dressed up in Star Wars outfits and battling with light sabres, it was
a nice distraction and helped to keep things interesting! I kept up with Andy and Stu
for the start of the long, grueling climb from World Cup to the feed station but they pretty quickly shot off in the distance.
After quite a long time I hit this final leg of the climb and got a bit of a kick and picked up the pace, just as I hit
the top I bumped into Ben. Unfortunately his seat post clamp had exploded at the bottom of World Cup so he'd been
riding the entire climb stood up - not much fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the feed station we found Andy and Stu again and stocked up on food and liquids (Stu left with more food than he started with!), we ended up being there for
about half an hour! During this time we bumped into a couple more faces we knew and Paul also turned up. At this point
the 5 of us set off together and pretty much just rode the rest of the way together. Ben was still pedalling stood up
right through to the end which kept him reigned in riding at our pace! A couple more descents and another crap climb or two saw
Paul and I at the top of 3in1 having been told that this would be the end we decided we'd take it easy down and just try to stay
in 1 piece. Paul flew off and I knew that there was no way we were taking it easy. We hurtled down and it was grins all round at the bottom,
despite Paul taking us through a tree. At the bottom we were greated by a pretty surreal sight of a beer tent with a disco.
We were given a free beer each and we couldn't be happier! We waited for Ben and then rolled down to the finish line. We finished in one
minute under 5 hours, not quite as quick as I'd planned but still my best time by quite some way! It was also unfortunate that
we didn't get to do the final descent but seeing that arrow pointing to the finish area not a big old climb up to
the final descent was very, very welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-QSaVjg4ETvM/T6moM51EQlI/AAAAAAAAAsQ/JtdojT-kfwU/s661/P1010122.JPG" /&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: small; text-align: center;"&gt;Welcome sight of the disco and beer tent!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-size: small; text-align: center;"&gt;Always a good sign!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pedalled back down into Machynlleth to the main event area to get our Dyfi Enduro mugs and to have a bit of a sit down and a natter
before heading back to Aber. An ace day of riding was topped off with a lovely meal in the Tynllidiart Arms in Capel Bangor.
A really great couple of days riding with a great group of people. Here's looking forward to next year!&lt;/p&gt;

They've felt
slow and forced to try make any speed on them, it's been fine over Clarach but for
some reason Nant and even the Dyfi just haven't felt right. Last night that changed,
I seemed to get my mojo back, the trails started to flow again and the speed was just there.
I think that dropping the forks down to 140mm has played a part in that as has having
a little less stress on my mind due to finding a place to live!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, last night I met up with the ystwyth guys at our usual spot up at Nant. I'd elected to
use spd's for this ride, my second offroad ride with them. I decided to use them as I
know the trails well and there isn't anything that I'd be worried about riding in them at all.
The first climb up the pendam climb felt pretty good, could notice the front end flicking up
less with the lower travel and I got up it feeling fine, but still the slowest! We rode over the
moorlands and headed to zorro. Zorro was good and felt fast, the last bit through the trees is
always nice and felt a bit faster this time than my last few rides. One very noticeable thing
so far into the ride was that my rear brake was squealing A LOT and not really doing much
in the way of slowing me down, no matter the front was getting the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up the leg burner, I found the guys stopped at the 3/4 mark. This was the fastest time
I've got up the 3/4 so far and also felt the best so far, fitness is certainly still
increasing at a fairly good rate. Upto Drunken Druid which felt significantly faster than
the last few times that I've ridden it and I cleared the short, sharp climb after it with
no problems, spd's doing their part there I think. Midway down High as a Kite I had a
bit of an incident with both ends washing out, to my amazement I clipped out without
even thinking about it and got in a dab. That single dab has upped my confidence in the spd's
no end!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italian job, Hippity Hop and the top of white fridge all rode great, although I did nearly
spd dump at the top of hippity hop! Back at the cars
I felt good. Most enjoyable nant ride that I've had in a while, everything just felt good!
At this point I decided to investigate that squeal, wheel off, pads out. Well, the picture below says
more than I can in words!&lt;/p&gt;

to a couple of the Dyfi enduro descents. We split into 2 groups and our group
went off to the top of the world cup descent to fill in a bit of a rut. The reasoning
behind this was that the 2 jumps near the beginning of the trail have been built up
a bit and the only real line leads straight into them! As such we filled in a bit of a massive
rut to provide a nice line that leads around the jumps. Think I'll have to hit the jumps
next Sunday, will be severely punished if I come up short though! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After filling in this rut we moved over to a piece of trail that I've not seen before
that will be used as a climb. It's fairly, steep and loose-ish, no surprises there. 
About midway up we met the second group clearing back some brash and draining a massive
puddle. Nothing much to do so we headed back down again. I get a feeling that I will
be off and pushing for this climb, it's hard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up we headed to 3in1 to cut in a bit of a new line at the top to get round
the huge puddle there. Lots of raking and general moving of bits and pieces and there
is now a nice line that should be quite good to ride over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, also - the weather was utterly, utterly gopping! Howling wind and tipping down for the
most part. Dyfi Enduro is going to be weeeeet!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="bikes"></category><category term="riding"></category><category term="trails"></category></entry><entry><title>Dyfi Pre-ride</title><link href="http://chvck.co.uk/posts/2012/Apr/22/dyfi-pre-ride/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-04-22T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>chuck</name></author><id>tag:chvck.co.uk,2012-04-22:posts/2012/Apr/22/dyfi-pre-ride/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Dyfi Enduro is 2 weeks today so today marked the dyfi pre-ride where a group of
us ride the potential route. Dan turned up at my truck at around 9am so we packed up
and got on the way, planning to arrive early so that I could change wheel and make sure the
brakes were aligned OK. About halfway there we stopped at some traffic lights and found
the car in front was Dave, doesn't matter how early I am I never arrive before him!
We arrived at the Climach-x car park and discovered that we were pretty much the last to
arrive, a few faces that I recognised and a few that I didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start saw us do the first climb of the enduro, not a fun climb! It's not too steep
though, just long so I sat and merrily span away until the top, at this point the weather
was spitting a bit. Once up that climb we continued up to the Elephant descent, no I have no
idea why it's called that. I somehow managed to be following Jon down it, he's pretty
terrifying to follow at the best of times. Before even reaching the big clay left hander he
managed to clip the edge of the rut and jump out of it, luckily without falling off.
Cue the big left hander and Jon on the floor, luckily unharmed. About another 100 metres
down the trail and I see Jon go through about 3 trees without bike, once again unharmed!
At this point I thought it best to overtake and had an uneventful rest of the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First descent done means time for another big ole climb, this one being largely more difficult!
After climbing up to the field I knew what was in store, a fairly steep offroad climb that
I'd never managed to do all in one go before let alone without dabbing. Success! For the
first time ever I managed the entire thing in one go without a single dab (though it came
close a couple of times!). That climb over it was time for another fun descent - Baileys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baileys is a steep, loose, exposed, rocky descent that's fast and fun! It'd worn down a bit since
the last time that I rode it so there were less little drops and it was smoother although
no less loose! Somehow I managed to be following Jon again, about half way down I saw him
go flying off to the left of the trail and stop, he looked fine so I continued on my way.
The big corner at the bottom has also worn away quite badly and there was a huge rut in it,
by chance I somehow wound up on the high line of it so avoided the rut. All down and accounted for
it turned out that Jon had lost a water bottle, not the most water bottle friendly place
the Dyfi!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued along for a short distance up a very short incline before hitting the next downhill,
which I cannot for the life of me remember! The next climb was a fairly long, tiring fireroad slogleading us up to the trail known as
The Big Dipper. This trail starts off undulating with some vicious, short rocky climbs. I didn't make it up
a couple of them. There were also some fairly serious puddles, several totally englufed my pedals
and feet along with them, as well as a couple where I stopped in the middle and had to get off and walk
through them! Once this bit was out of the way the trail continued in normal dyfi fashion, rocky n steep!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For once we didn't have to ride uphill post-descent as we rode straight into the World Cup descent,
a fantastic bit of trail. Starting out fast and fairly flowy with massive ruts all over the place and a
handul of jumps spotted about the place the trail transforms into very, very steep bedrock. Words can't
quite describe how fun this descent is and it's all over far too fast. Pete got a flat midway down so
we stopped for a breather whilst we waited for him to come down. The end of this descent also
marks the start of a very long slog which is fairly steep in places. After a brief break we started 
out on said climb. At the top of this climb is where the feed station is usually situated so we stopped
for a break and some food where the feed station would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onward and steep and rocky the order of the day once again! Midway down the top of this descent I got caught between 2 lines
and a moment of indecision of whether to hold the high line or drop into a rut saw me on the floor.
Unscathed I let through the guys behind me and continued, just so happened that Dan had also stopped about 5 metres
away from me. Within 10 metres I saw Dan get completely sideways as he hit a muddy off camber
section of a rut, unfornately by this point I was already committed to his line! Luckily we both
rode it out and stopped at the next fireroad for a quick relieved laugh before continuing on
downhill with no more issues. At the bottom we discovered that Jon had once again lost
a bottle and was hiking back off up the trail to find it. Once we had regrouped it was back off uphill
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fairly short climb saw us at the top of the next descent, this one I usually have a moment or two on!
This is a (obviously) fairly steep trail that is covered in water and bedrock, Dan set off and I decided to
follow him, for some reason he decided to choose a line that was pretty much in a stream and I decided
to follow him. We reached the bottom with no issues and I knew what was coming. This was the only climb of the day
where I had to get off and walk, a quite steep, rocky, singletrack climb. I wasn't alone in my pushing efforts, a few of us
decided that it was the best plan of action. After a while this trail started to point back downhill,
a downhill that's (you guessed it) steep and rocky but also full of whoops, great fun! Once again got down to the bottom
with no problems and prepared myself for the next climb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this point my legs were starting to ache but I knew that the climb took us to the top of
3 in 1, a descent not far from the cars. After slogging away for a while I reached the top, most of the
group was already there! A brief discussion about the next course of action decided that everyone
would go down 3 in 1 and then split into 2 groups - 1 going back to the cars and the other climbing up to the
Dyfi final descent. At this point I was starting to think that heading back would be nice. We coninuted onto the 3 in 1
going around a massive puddle with mud all over everywhere. 3 in 1 is very muddy as
well as being steep, rocky and flowy and great fun and fast. I had a couple of moments as I wasn't
following anyone so could tear along at my own speed, I caught up to Dan near the bottom where the little beer
tent will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone down the group split into 2, I knew that Dan would want to continue and I wasn't feeling so bad now, I
decided that I could manage another climb. We said bye to the guys going home and cracked on, I had a good pace going on until
the climb got a bit steeper and I started to really feel it in my legs, luckily Dave pulled alongside me so
we had a chat which helped to forget about my legs. At the top of the worst bit Dave stopped to wait for the
others and make sure that they didn't go the wrong way so I continued on not really knowing where to go. Just as I
thought that I must have taken a wrong turning I saw 3 figures on the fireroad ahead a bit and descended down to
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dyfi final descent, I'd only done this trail once previously and could only really remember
1 big bed-rocky corner. Dan went off and I followed, he stopped within about 20 metres shouting something about
lock out so I passed him and razzed down a very fun bit of track before hitting 'that' corner.
I couldn't really see what line to take so just hit the rock and slid on down into the rut at the bottom,
no problems! After this it was very fast and a bit pedally, getting a bit drifty in a big right hander it was ace
fun. Unforntunately we then came across a digger taking up the entire track and loads of brash all
over the place. A brief walk to get round all that and the trail finished off with a fast, muddy section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once everyone was down it was grins all round and we set off along the road back to the carpark. Getting back upto
said car park is a steep climb. I was determined to do it and for the first time ever I got cramp in my leg!
None-the-less I managed to ride up the climb and was pretty happy. We stopped for a brief chat and said our goodbyes and
set off home. Ace ride!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ride was really, really excellent with a great group of people. It reminded me that the Dyfi
descents are a hoot and can be pretty dangerous if you don't keep your mind in the game.
This also marked my first ride post reducing the travel in the lyriks. I could certainly
tell the difference on the climbs, I rarely had issues with the front lifting and I don't
think that I noticed any difference on the descents. A mixture of the lower travel and being
much fitter than previously meant that I cleaned climbs that i haven't before and didn't
have to push up any fireroads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring on the Dyfi Enduro!&lt;/p&gt;

It's
pretty much everything that Dave told me that it would be but it still didn't fail
to surprise me with just how steep parts are. We started out with a bit of a climb on
a fireroad until reaching a descent that instantly screamed Dyfi at me. Steep &amp;amp; rocky
with woops to pump, very much like many of the Dyfi descents and formed in the same way
by 4x4s and moto bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit more riding through some steep, muddy stuff that saw me pushing
and we came to what Dave described as the fireroad from hell, it started out fairly steep and then
continued to increase in steepness to the point that I couldn't ride it.
Sat down the front just lifted and stood up the rear just span, at one
point I found myself pointing back down the hill - that signalled time to get off and push.
At the top of this climb we were on top of the hill with the wind turbines, the largest in
Wales apparently, we counted 38 but I'm sure that there were more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After pootling along the top for a bit we came to the descent that we'd come out for.
Dave had told me that this would be steep but that didn't quite prepare me for just
how steep and loose it was! I didn't dare to let off the brakes for fear that I wouldn't
stop if I did. We both got down with no casualties although I did have a bit of moment
having decided to let off the brakes down some bedrock, I very quickly found the bike going sideways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having reached the bottom of this we continued going down on some quite mellow singletrack,
somehow this section saw the only off of the evening. Dave hit a rock and went OTB,
he got up fine but we quickly noticed that his brake lever had popped out of the
reservoir leaving him with no front brake. One more quick descent and a fair bit of climbing and
we were back at the cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all a great ride and we barely even needed our lights, only using them for the
very end of the ride. The way that I would define the area is as an intense Dyfi forest.
Much like the Dyfi you're either going up or down and everything is steep, Myherin is just
steeper and more brutal!&lt;/p&gt;
