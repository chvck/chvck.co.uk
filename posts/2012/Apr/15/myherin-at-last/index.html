    <h2><a href="../../../../../posts/2012/Apr/15/myherin-at-last/">Myherin - at last</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 15 Apr 2012</h3>
        
      <p>Finally made it over to Myherin with the Ystwyth guys, well just Dave Reed. It's
pretty much everything that Dave told me that it would be but it still didn't fail
to surprise me with just how steep parts are. We started out with a bit of a climb on
a fireroad until reaching a descent that instantly screamed Dyfi at me. Steep &amp; rocky
with woops to pump, very much like many of the Dyfi descents and formed in the same way
by 4x4s and moto bikes.</p>
<p>A bit more riding through some steep, muddy stuff that saw me pushing
and we came to what Dave described as the fireroad from hell, it started out fairly steep and then
continued to increase in steepness to the point that I couldn't ride it.
Sat down the front just lifted and stood up the rear just span, at one
point I found myself pointing back down the hill - that signalled time to get off and push.
At the top of this climb we were on top of the hill with the wind turbines, the largest in
Wales apparently, we counted 38 but I'm sure that there were more.</p>
<p>After pootling along the top for a bit we came to the descent that we'd come out for.
Dave had told me that this would be steep but that didn't quite prepare me for just
how steep and loose it was! I didn't dare to let off the brakes for fear that I wouldn't
stop if I did. We both got down with no casualties although I did have a bit of moment
having decided to let off the brakes down some bedrock, I very quickly found the bike going sideways.</p>
<p>Having reached the bottom of this we continued going down on some quite mellow singletrack,
somehow this section saw the only off of the evening. Dave hit a rock and went OTB,
he got up fine but we quickly noticed that his brake lever had popped out of the
reservoir leaving him with no front brake. One more quick descent and a fair bit of climbing and
we were back at the cars.</p>
<p>All in all a great ride and we barely even needed our lights, only using them for the
very end of the ride. The way that I would define the area is as an intense Dyfi forest.
Much like the Dyfi you're either going up or down and everything is steep, Myherin is just
steeper and more brutal!</p>
