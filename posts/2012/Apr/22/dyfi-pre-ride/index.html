    <h2><a href="../../../../../posts/2012/Apr/22/dyfi-pre-ride/">Dyfi Pre-ride</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 22 Apr 2012</h3>
        
      <p>The Dyfi Enduro is 2 weeks today so today marked the dyfi pre-ride where a group of
us ride the potential route. Dan turned up at my truck at around 9am so we packed up
and got on the way, planning to arrive early so that I could change wheel and make sure the
brakes were aligned OK. About halfway there we stopped at some traffic lights and found
the car in front was Dave, doesn't matter how early I am I never arrive before him!
We arrived at the Climach-x car park and discovered that we were pretty much the last to
arrive, a few faces that I recognised and a few that I didn't.</p>
<p>The start saw us do the first climb of the enduro, not a fun climb! It's not too steep
though, just long so I sat and merrily span away until the top, at this point the weather
was spitting a bit. Once up that climb we continued up to the Elephant descent, no I have no
idea why it's called that. I somehow managed to be following Jon down it, he's pretty
terrifying to follow at the best of times. Before even reaching the big clay left hander he
managed to clip the edge of the rut and jump out of it, luckily without falling off.
Cue the big left hander and Jon on the floor, luckily unharmed. About another 100 metres
down the trail and I see Jon go through about 3 trees without bike, once again unharmed!
At this point I thought it best to overtake and had an uneventful rest of the trail.</p>
<p>First descent done means time for another big ole climb, this one being largely more difficult!
After climbing up to the field I knew what was in store, a fairly steep offroad climb that
I'd never managed to do all in one go before let alone without dabbing. Success! For the
first time ever I managed the entire thing in one go without a single dab (though it came
close a couple of times!). That climb over it was time for another fun descent - Baileys.</p>
<p>Baileys is a steep, loose, exposed, rocky descent that's fast and fun! It'd worn down a bit since
the last time that I rode it so there were less little drops and it was smoother although
no less loose! Somehow I managed to be following Jon again, about half way down I saw him
go flying off to the left of the trail and stop, he looked fine so I continued on my way.
The big corner at the bottom has also worn away quite badly and there was a huge rut in it,
by chance I somehow wound up on the high line of it so avoided the rut. All down and accounted for
it turned out that Jon had lost a water bottle, not the most water bottle friendly place
the Dyfi!</p>
<p>We continued along for a short distance up a very short incline before hitting the next downhill,
which I cannot for the life of me remember! The next climb was a fairly long, tiring fireroad slogleading us up to the trail known as
The Big Dipper. This trail starts off undulating with some vicious, short rocky climbs. I didn't make it up
a couple of them. There were also some fairly serious puddles, several totally englufed my pedals
and feet along with them, as well as a couple where I stopped in the middle and had to get off and walk
through them! Once this bit was out of the way the trail continued in normal dyfi fashion, rocky n steep!</p>
<p>For once we didn't have to ride uphill post-descent as we rode straight into the World Cup descent,
a fantastic bit of trail. Starting out fast and fairly flowy with massive ruts all over the place and a
handul of jumps spotted about the place the trail transforms into very, very steep bedrock. Words can't
quite describe how fun this descent is and it's all over far too fast. Pete got a flat midway down so
we stopped for a breather whilst we waited for him to come down. The end of this descent also
marks the start of a very long slog which is fairly steep in places. After a brief break we started 
out on said climb. At the top of this climb is where the feed station is usually situated so we stopped
for a break and some food where the feed station would be.</p>
<p>Onward and steep and rocky the order of the day once again! Midway down the top of this descent I got caught between 2 lines
and a moment of indecision of whether to hold the high line or drop into a rut saw me on the floor.
Unscathed I let through the guys behind me and continued, just so happened that Dan had also stopped about 5 metres
away from me. Within 10 metres I saw Dan get completely sideways as he hit a muddy off camber
section of a rut, unfornately by this point I was already committed to his line! Luckily we both
rode it out and stopped at the next fireroad for a quick relieved laugh before continuing on
downhill with no more issues. At the bottom we discovered that Jon had once again lost
a bottle and was hiking back off up the trail to find it. Once we had regrouped it was back off uphill
again.</p>
<p>A fairly short climb saw us at the top of the next descent, this one I usually have a moment or two on!
This is a (obviously) fairly steep trail that is covered in water and bedrock, Dan set off and I decided to
follow him, for some reason he decided to choose a line that was pretty much in a stream and I decided
to follow him. We reached the bottom with no issues and I knew what was coming. This was the only climb of the day
where I had to get off and walk, a quite steep, rocky, singletrack climb. I wasn't alone in my pushing efforts, a few of us
decided that it was the best plan of action. After a while this trail started to point back downhill,
a downhill that's (you guessed it) steep and rocky but also full of whoops, great fun! Once again got down to the bottom
with no problems and prepared myself for the next climb.</p>
<p>By this point my legs were starting to ache but I knew that the climb took us to the top of
3 in 1, a descent not far from the cars. After slogging away for a while I reached the top, most of the
group was already there! A brief discussion about the next course of action decided that everyone
would go down 3 in 1 and then split into 2 groups - 1 going back to the cars and the other climbing up to the
Dyfi final descent. At this point I was starting to think that heading back would be nice. We coninuted onto the 3 in 1
going around a massive puddle with mud all over everywhere. 3 in 1 is very muddy as
well as being steep, rocky and flowy and great fun and fast. I had a couple of moments as I wasn't
following anyone so could tear along at my own speed, I caught up to Dan near the bottom where the little beer
tent will be.</p>
<p>Everyone down the group split into 2, I knew that Dan would want to continue and I wasn't feeling so bad now, I
decided that I could manage another climb. We said bye to the guys going home and cracked on, I had a good pace going on until
the climb got a bit steeper and I started to really feel it in my legs, luckily Dave pulled alongside me so
we had a chat which helped to forget about my legs. At the top of the worst bit Dave stopped to wait for the
others and make sure that they didn't go the wrong way so I continued on not really knowing where to go. Just as I
thought that I must have taken a wrong turning I saw 3 figures on the fireroad ahead a bit and descended down to
them.</p>
<p>The Dyfi final descent, I'd only done this trail once previously and could only really remember
1 big bed-rocky corner. Dan went off and I followed, he stopped within about 20 metres shouting something about
lock out so I passed him and razzed down a very fun bit of track before hitting 'that' corner.
I couldn't really see what line to take so just hit the rock and slid on down into the rut at the bottom,
no problems! After this it was very fast and a bit pedally, getting a bit drifty in a big right hander it was ace
fun. Unforntunately we then came across a digger taking up the entire track and loads of brash all
over the place. A brief walk to get round all that and the trail finished off with a fast, muddy section.</p>
<p>Once everyone was down it was grins all round and we set off along the road back to the carpark. Getting back upto
said car park is a steep climb. I was determined to do it and for the first time ever I got cramp in my leg!
None-the-less I managed to ride up the climb and was pretty happy. We stopped for a brief chat and said our goodbyes and
set off home. Ace ride!</p>
<p>This ride was really, really excellent with a great group of people. It reminded me that the Dyfi
descents are a hoot and can be pretty dangerous if you don't keep your mind in the game.
This also marked my first ride post reducing the travel in the lyriks. I could certainly
tell the difference on the climbs, I rarely had issues with the front lifting and I don't
think that I noticed any difference on the descents. A mixture of the lower travel and being
much fitter than previously meant that I cleaned climbs that i haven't before and didn't
have to push up any fireroads.</p>
<p>Bring on the Dyfi Enduro!</p>
