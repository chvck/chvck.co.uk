    <h2><a href="http://chvck.co.uk/posts/2013/Apr/14/pro-ride-guides-airtime-course/">Pro Ride Guides Airtime Course</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 14 Apr 2013</h3>
        
      <p>A while back Ben and I decided that a skills course could be a good idea. 
He found a jumps and drops course at Forest of Dean that is run by
<a href="http://prorideguides.com/">Pro Ride Guides</a>. We found a date and sent the info
on the others, it ended up being Ben, Taylor and myself booked onto the course.
Today we did the course.</p>
<p>I got to the Forest of Dean at about 9.30 and Taylor n Ben showed up shortly afterward.
Some faffing occured and we headed over to meet the 2 other guys and the coach - Dave, Chris and Al
respectively. We had a brief chat and did some basic bike checks so that Al knew that we weren't
riding death traps. We set out for a short spin on the blue route just to warm up a bit
and get a fresh feeling of our bikes.</p>
<p>Once we'd done that we were at the top of a fireroad. Al explained how to correctly get into the 
attack position and how it should feel - he wanted us to be in that position with the rear brake 
covered for most of the day. Next he showed us how to correctly bring the bike into a manual (seems to be the key!) so we practised
that for a while before progressing it into a bunny hop. An emphasis over the day was landing softly so we
also had a go at that with the bunny hops. This part felt pretty good and already it was
pretty clear I've got a nice collection of bad habits!</p>
<p>We then moved onto a small drop onto a fireroad to practise the technique for that. I was having some trouble with
not pogo-ing upward at this point, something of a bad habit there as well. After that we pedalled up to the top of the hill
and spent some time on a tabletop getting to grips with the jumping correctly part. This was also pretty difficult! We all
started to get the hang of it though. Then it was time for lunch so we continued down the trail to the bottom trying practise pumping and
jumping on our way down. He also told us to keep as light as possible on the bars so that front wheel can track better.</p>
<p>After lunch we returned to the small jumpy section where we had pactised the drops and setup on a jump that we could land
on top of but had a distinct take off and landing. We put what we'd learnt into practise gradually adding more speed to try clear
the jump. Ben managed to get the hang of it pretty quickly although he did almost attempt to superman off the front of the bike
at one point. I was finding that I was getting the technique right more often by now and could tell when I had as it felt much
better. Gradually adding speed it was all beginning to sink in. Once Al was happy that we were all capable of doing that he moved us onto
a pretty small drop into a relatively steep slope.  We spent some time putting into practise what we'd done earlier and everyone managed it
with no problems what-so-ever. During these 2 sections it was also interesting to watch other people (not on the course) coming down and
see how they were doing it wrong - with Al whincing almost every time in case they nailed themselves! </p>
<p>Once we'd got the hang of that drop we pedalled back to the top of the hill and played on a tabletop up there. At this point
Al also showed us how to manual tables so we had a crack at that - Chris was pretty good at it and Taylor managed to get it 
really well on his last attempt. Ben and I weren't so great - more practise needed! We then did the descent we had done earlier
trying to put into practise everything that we learnt but we said our goodbyes and headed off home.</p>
<p>I feel like I got a lot out of the course. Whilst I don't feel like I cracked it during the day it's given me 
the knowledge and theory that I needed so that I can come away and practise, practise, practise. Trying to practise
jumps and drops around Oxford might be difficult but I can certainly practise the manuals and bunny hops - so I will be!
Al was great - he was friendly, approachable and cracking jokes all day. He never seemed to get fed up of labouring
the same points so that they hit home with us. A majorly key concept from the day seemed to be to relax!</p>
