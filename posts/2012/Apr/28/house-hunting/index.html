    <h2><a href="../../../../../posts/2012/Apr/28/house-hunting/">House hunting</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 28 Apr 2012</h3>
        
      <p>This week I've spent Wednesday-Friday flat/house hunting for a place to rent for
when we move down to Oxford. I had about 7 places lined up to go look at over the 2.5
days which increased to 9 whilst I was down there. Tuesday night I drove down to Georges
where I would be staying.</p>
<p>Wednesday I only had 2 bookings and in the morning that got reduced to 1 by an estate
agent bailing out. As George was feeling a bit crap I gave him a lift into Oxford to work which
was surprisingly easier than I had suspected it would be, I also ended up taking him in and picking
him up all 3 days! At midday I went to my first booking which was in Kennington which looked
to be a pretty good location for getting into Oxford, upon arriving I noticed that there
was also a pub pretty much the other side of the road, always a good thing! This flat was furnished
and was quite nice but incredibly small and on the second floor so the road bike would be a bit
of a hassle both to fit and get in. It was pretty much 2 rooms, a living area with the kitchen attached
and a bedroom with en-suite. At this point it's worth mentioning that Oxford prices are bloody
insane! I couldn't quite see how the price of this place was justified given the size of it, guess the price
reflected the location. I managed to get from the door of the property into the centre of Oxford, including
parking and getting on the p&amp;r bus, within 15 minutes - not bad going! Naturally, being in Oxford, I had 2 burrito's.</p>
<p>Thursday I had 6 bookings lined up starting from 10am so I dropped George into work and headed back to Abingdon
and set off to the marina. This flat was in a nice development area and wasn't a bad sized flat (ground floor) with a communal
garden type area. I wasn't massively taken with it though unfortunately, the location was right at the bottom of Abingdon
so not as good for Oxford or the A34 as the other properties I had lined up. I can't even remember how this place
was laid out! After the viewing I followed the estate agent to my next viewing at the Vineyard flats. The next place
was also a second floor flat but once again a decent size. I was taken by the kitchen which was once
again joined to the living area but both areas were large and there was a nice breakfast bar as a kind of
separator. I mentally noted this place as worth keeping in mind. At this point I was pretty close to George's flat so headed back,
my next viewing was in the same development as his flat. I met the estate agent and it actually turned out to the be the next
door down from George! Another second floor flat and this one was quite small despite the agent keep saying
she was impressed with the size of it. I've forgotten what this one was like as I wasn't at all taken!</p>
<p>Next 2 viewings were in Botley and I noticed that they were the most expensive ones I was viewing, I didn't book
these! First one was yet another second floor apartment and was OK but the kitchen was utterly tiny and had quite a
lot of road noise. For the price I was majorly unimpressed and getting a bit worried that I wasn't going to find anywhere.
After this viewing I had a thrilling time sat in the car for an hour waiting for my next viewing. This viewing
was an actual house which I quite interested by. Upon walking to the door I could tell it was going to be fairly small, the house
is on the end of a block and the door is actually round the side not on the front like the other houses! We walked in and
I was instantly impressed with the layout, kitchen was a decent size and quite nice and it had a downstairs toilet too! The
main living area was very nice and spacious and had wooden floors. There was a small conservatory which was nice and a private
garden area which was gravel and paved with a shed, A SHED, this one I could actually bring my mtb to! Upstairs had 2 bedrooms
and a bathroom which all looked alright. After a bried chat with the agent he said that a small cat wouldn't be a problem
and that for the right tenatnts the landlady was prepared to knock 70 quid a month off the advertised price. Bingo, this
was very much on my radar now! Quite ideal location too with good access to both A34 and Oxford.</p>
<p>Next I popped back to Abingdon for the last viewing of the day. This property was another house but I can't remember
much about it now, I wasn't very excited by it especially the lack of white goods. I went into Oxford a bit early to pick George up as i'd arranged a chat with One Ltd
just to say hi and discuss what they do etc... They were really, really nice and we had a good laugh too, hopefully
I'll bump into them at hack days, geek nights etc... Friday morning I popped George into Oxford and headed back to Abingdon for
my final viewing, this was a ground floor flat and was quite big. Massive joint area for the main living space and
kitchen. 2 bedrooms, en-suite and a main bathroom. I decided that this would be a good backup flat as I wanted to try
get the one in Botley. I rang the agent and told him that we wanted it but he told me that there was another viewing
in the afternoon and that the landlady wanted to honour it, fair enough. I packed mine and George's stuff into the car
and headed off. I was at the farm when Maura called me to say that the landlady wanted the weekend to consider who
to take on as the other party who viewing had expressed an interest, made me nervous! In the evening I popped to the
lime kiln with Ben and drank about 4 pints more than planned.</p>
<p>Today I woke up feeling groggy but with a text from Maura saying that we had the property! I rang the agent
and got the fees paid straight away. So we're now sorted so long as we pass all the various checks that
the agents run on us. All very exciting and had to try to think of a way to find some furniture and hope Maura
gets a job in Oxford pretty quickly as we're going to be Ok but a bit low on spare cash otherwise. Whilst on the farm I also
took a look at the array of solar panels that Dad had installed on one of the sheds, pretty cool! Here's a picture of the shed
at the house we're hopefully going to be renting! I will be fortifying it A LOT.</p>
