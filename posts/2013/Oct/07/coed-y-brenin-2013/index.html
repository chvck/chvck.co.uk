    <h2><a href="http://chvck.co.uk/posts/2013/Oct/07/coed-y-brenin-2013/">Coed-y-brenin 2013</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 07 Oct 2013</h3>
        
      <p>This weekend marked the annual Coed-y-brenin Enduro, a 60km mountain bike endurance event. Last year Ben and I did it, it took
us 8.5 hours (according to my gps) and we were nearly dead last. Felt utterly destroyed at the end and swore to never do it again.
Somehow, we wound up doing it again.</p>
<h2>Saturday</h2>
<p>I've been talking about Myherin to the others for a while now so put a plan in action to get it done. We met Dave Reed and Pete
in the arches car park and set about waiting for Ben and Rich to turn up. Which they did, 40 minutes late! Unfortunately, I wasn't 
feeling great so the descents were a bit hairy and the climbs just hurt. I cut the loop a bit short with Dave, we just skipped Blaen
Myherin whilst the others went off that way. We cut off at the steep climb and just headed back via Brashy Dive. I then met the others in
Aberystwyth. I think that they enjoyed the ride!</p>
<p>After grabbing some food for the evening we headed off up to our log cabin near Coed-y-brenin. It was pretty snug but had everything we needed
and was really comfy. At this point we also met up with 2 of Ben's mates who we were sharing the cabin with, Conrad and Nath. We cooked a big
ole pasta bake and then watched utterly dire films until bed time.</p>
<p><img alt="The cabin" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GZNerN0dt7w/UlJ5vlO1zyI/AAAAAAAADfQ/zPVT01EoZds/s640/P1000364.JPG" /></p>
<h2>Sunday</h2>
<p>Starting out how all big bike days do - porridge and a cuppa tea. We packed up all of our stuff and headed off to coedy to sign up and get riding.
The sign on had moved this year down to the newly kitted out visitors centre, although we didn't go inside to have a look. By the time we got there 
and signed on, met up with Jase etc... it was about time to go join the starting queue. We opted to queue about 3/4 of the way back as we had no plans to go racing.
The first few km were slow and a tad stop/start until the pack thinned out. The first descent (cane &amp; abel) was a fair queue although completely 
cleared by the time we hit the actual descent. This may have been because we pointed out a path near the descents and joked we should go ride that. A lot
of the people around us decided that, in fact, that was exactly what they were going to do.</p>
<p><img alt="Signed on" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3oMwMgUBOMo/UlJ95O-9hQI/AAAAAAAADgg/50tdLfhQchI/s640/P1000373.JPG" />

<p>The ride had some great descents and a few tough climbs mixing up both fire track and singletrack. Of note were the steep, slippery, rad descent down to the river
(not trail centre) although I did hit a tree causing our mini-train to stop and then hit my pedal on a rock just before a chute causing another stop, although still
managed to ride them out. Sorry guys! Rocky horror near the end was also a good bit of trail although by that point my body felt like I'd been in a fight. </p>

<p>It was an awesome weekend full of good riding. Will probably do the coedy again next year too, didn't feel nearly as bad this year - although didn't feel that ride during the ride.
Thanks to all the Summit crew who made it happen as well as the people manning the feed station and the emergency services crew(s?), and everyone else involved!</p>
