    <h2><a href="../../../../../posts/2013/Jan/07/lets-talk-ms/">Let's talk MS</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 07 Jan 2013</h3>
        
      <p>No, not Microsoft; I'm talking about Multiple Sclerosis. I was diagnosed with this back in October, part of the reason for
writing this is so that anyone who I tell who has no idea about it can be directed here. Another part is so that in the future
I can log any relapses that I have and keep a record. So I'd best start out with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis">what it is</a>.
At a very basic level if we think about electrical wiring then you have the core wire that carries the signal and a coating that
prevents anything messing with that core wire, causing short circuits. This is kinda like nerves, you have the nerve and it has a sheath of something
called Myelin. In MS something causes the immune system to attack this Myelin sheath leaving the exposed nerve open to damage.
This can have (what I understand are) fairly random effects with varying levels of severity. There are also 2 types: relapsing remitting
and progressive. I have the former and don't ever want the latter, for further reading the <a href="http://www.mstrust.org.uk/">MS Trust Website</a> has proved fairly
invaluable.</p>
<p>Let's move onto how it's affected me. I've had a handful of relapses now although none have been what I'd call severe, none of
them have altered my lifestyle. Trying to pinpoint when it started is pretty difficult but for ages I had slightly less sensation
down the left hand side of my body and I also had tingling in my feet, legs and sometimes my torso when I looked down.
The tingling is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lhermitte's_sign">L'hermitte's sign</a>, naturally I ignored it for ages!
When I did finally go to the doctor they sent me off for MRI scans of which I had 2 in Aberystywth and 1 in Swansea. The Swansea
machine is much, much nicer - the one in Aberystwyth was actually painful, the head cradle has pointy bits and I was once in it for 1.5 hours! I never
followed up the one in Swansea until September when I went to a GP in Oxford and they chased it, the GP suspected MS and referred me to a specialist. I've had a few other things too,
my eyesight in my right eye has gone blurry twice and I lost pretty much all skin sensation on my left leg once, each of these relapses
has only lasted a week or two. I can't remember if I've had anything else. To be fair I can live with loss of sensation, it's loss of use of limbs or the like that I'd rather
not ever get! Typically after a relapse the symptoms go away or at least do for the most part. Currently the only thing that I have
is that my finger tips have lost some sensation and that seems to be fairly permanent.</p>
<p>Onto the drugs, as I've had more than 2 relapses in a year I'm eligable for disease modifying medication. These drugs are meant
to reduce the number of relapses. The consultant told me that typically people have 3 relapses a year and with the drugs that
tend to drop to 2, given that the effect of a relapse seems pretty random reducing them seems like a good idea to me. The drug that I've chosen
is something called <a href="http://www.mstrust.org.uk/atoz/betaferon.jsp">Betaferon</a> of the Beta Interferon family. I'm not going to
pretend that I have a clue about what it does or that I really made an informed decision about which drug to use. My choice
was made on what I thought fitted my lifestyle/impacted upon it the least which is what I was told to make the decision on. Each drug has a nice list of side effects but the most
common for this one appears to be flu like symptoms for the first 3 months or so. My appointment to find out how to use the drugs
and my first injection is a week on Tuesday so I guess that Wednesday will be fairly revealing.</p>
<p>Thus far the nurses and doctors of John Radcliffe Hospital and DK Earley and Partners have been fantastic and explained everything really
well to me. No doubt I'll be seeing plenty more of them.</p>
<p>So all that is certain is that the future is rather uncertain but, hell, whose isn't?! I'll continue to live my life as I always
have and deal with any obstacles as they happen, much like everyone else does...</p>
