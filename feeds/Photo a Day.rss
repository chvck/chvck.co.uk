I've tried this for the past 2 years and just failed so this year I'm going to attempt
to write a short blog post about each photo to try to make myself think about what my photo will be.
Hopefully, this year I'll actually manage to do it!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">chuck</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:chvck.co.uk,2013-01-01:posts/2013/Jan/01/2013-photo-a-day/</guid><category>random</category><category>photo a day 2013</category></item></channel></rss>
