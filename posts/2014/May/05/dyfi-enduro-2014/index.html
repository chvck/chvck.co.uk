    <h2><a href="http://chvck.co.uk/posts/2014/May/05/dyfi-enduro-2014/">Dyfi Enduro 2014</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 05 May 2014</h3>
        
      <p>This weekend marked the annual <a href="http://www.summitcycles.co.uk/enduro/">Dyfi Enduro</a> ride, this year a choice was given 
to ride 45km or 55km. I entered the 55km with the aim of getting to the bar at the bottom of dickos within around 4 hours.
Having done the loop with Ben a few weeks ago in 4.5 hours with plenty of stopping this goal seemed achievable.</p>
<h2>Friday</h2>
<p>Paul came over Thursday night and we headed to Eastridge to meet Andy so that I could show them round. We had a great ride
and Andy had no trouble at all with the steep line, I managed to crash on it twice! We rode all the usual suspects although Paul ran most
of it and freewheeled the descents as his rear mech hanger snapped just before the zig zag climb.</p>
<p><img alt="Broken mech hanger" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-PHwmz-5TlCw/U2d5cMoI2mI/AAAAAAAAEMU/mgAXcL9s-fo/s640/P1000550.JPG" /></p>
<p>After riding, Paul and I continued on to aber to Dan's house where we'd be staying the night. We met up with Joe and Nick for some food in the <a href="http://www.glengower.co.uk/">glen</a>
before moving on to the ship and castle for more beer than was planned. Dan, the genius, had left some chicken cooking whilst we were out so we came back to a full meal of chicken with
rice n peas. Top job! </p>
<h2>Saturday</h2>
<p>On Saturday we met Joe, Nick and a few others at Capel Dewi for a bit of a play about on some DH tracks. One side of the woods is quite lost to fallen trees
but there are still plenty of tracks. I managed to badly case a double and hit my shoulder pretty hard but walked away from it so all good but a bit sore now. Joe hit the smallest (it ain't small) of the
road gaps a couple of times and generally a good time was had by all. After riding Paul and I headed on to Mach and setup our tents etc... before being joined by Ben n Steph shortly after.
Once Jase arrived we headed off to find food and wound up with dirty kebab shop pizzas, did the job though. We had a drink or two each in the beer tent before heading off to bed.</p>

<h2>Sunday</h2>
<p>The main event! Around 10.30 we headed to queue up for the start, already we were starting quite a way back and the start wasn't until 11! We had the rider briefing and off we went. I wanted to get
to the top of the first climb as quickly as I could to avoid the bottleneck that always occurs at the first descent. That, I managed to do - along with Paul and Harris. Shortly after the first descent I lost them
after I stopped for a wee. I was feeling quite good until I fell off on the second part of baileys. I was on some bedrock and both of my wheels disappeared as I tried to alter my line. Luckily I got away with no
major damage but did bruise both of my hands which made for some painful descending the rest of the day. Jase passed me as I was having a break at the top of World Cup and I managed to catch him on the climb so we rode together
up to the feed station. Cake, hi5 and nanas consumed it was quickly time to crack on again. </p>
<p>At this point we were riding with Paul and Harris again but once again they all quite quickly disappeared into the distance.
I pushed the whole of the singletrack climb up to goshawk as my legs were hurting pretty badly but I got a pretty clear run down goshawk which was ace. At the bottom I hopped into a compression and BANG, tyre was flat instantly.
I couldn't see any problems with the tyre so thought that it had somehow just burped majorly. Threw a tube in and off I went. Half way up the next climb I heard a hissing... Jumped off the bike and found that the tube was poking through
a big hole in the tyre. Balls. I'd used my only tube so started walking, a very kind chap gave me a tube so I set to work with my toothpaste tube tyre boot but, alas, it wasn't big enough for the hole. Another very generous person
came to my rescue and gave me a Park Tool tyre boot. I managed to get it all fitted (took a few goes as even that boot wasn't quite big enough) and wahey I was off again. I was quite fresh by this point having rested for
over 30 minutes fixing the tyre so stormed up to dickos. I decided that it probably wasn't a great plan to ride dickos so tried to skirt round on a fireroad. Just after I passed the first crossing on dickos the fireroad went uphill
again and I was not having that so cracked on down dickos itself. Just past the photographer and about 10 metres from the end of the track I crashed again, scraping my right hand side down some rocks. That one hurt a bit but
all the damage was superficial so I picked myself back up and got myself over to the bar at the bottom for a small beer.</p>
<p><img alt="Tyre hole" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ZaeuWwRaZo4/U2eCTi620vI/AAAAAAAAETM/izh6Y8DYLf4/s640/P1000611.JPG" /></p>
<p>At this point I decided that the long route probably wasn't wise with a big hole in my tyre so headed to the finish. Luckily, Paul had only just finished the long loop so we headed back together. About half way back my bike 
started to get a bit bouncy, another tube down. Paul had a large boot in the form of part of a milk carton so we fitted that and a new tube. That got me back to mach no worries where we got our mugs and caught up with everyone 
else to see how they got on.</p>
<p>After showers we wandered over the road to where there was a smaller beer tent and a couple of food vendors. We first went for mexican from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Green-Goat-Cafe/353083144764903">the Green Goat</a>.
Jolly good it was too, this beer tent was empty so we also managed to use some sofas which was somewhat nice!</p>
<p><img alt="Smaller beer tent" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-46VMWfO9jU0/U2eBU1zBmRI/AAAAAAAAESM/P3C9kCDrBeQ/s640/P1000602.JPG" /></p>
<p><img alt="Courtyard" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-b-iDkCoZ8zE/U2eBsnF8QXI/AAAAAAAAESk/ERyI_zjTTvg/s640/P1000604.JPG" /></p>
<p>We then chose to sample the burger stand, I had falafel. This was also a win, after another drink we headed back to Dyfi HQ where we drank some more and caught up with old faces. There was also some entertainment
in the form of a fire ring with people riding through it.</p>
<p><img alt="Fire ring" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bPaIResIlSc/U2eCM1GOzaI/AAAAAAAAETE/gqy7hlOYFmA/s640/P1000610.JPG" /></p>
<p>A cracking weekend despite the actual dyfi ride not going my way. Big respect to Paul for riding it singlespeed when he isn't used to it. Big thanks to the organisers and all of the marshalls and people lining the course
in various places too. I managed somewhere around 4h30 for the 45km loop so if I hadn't had problems with my tyre then I'm confident I would have made the bar by 4 hours.</p>
