I was diagnosed with this back in October, part of the reason for
writing this is so that anyone who I tell who has no idea about it can be directed here. Another part is so that in the future
I can log any relapses that I have and keep a record. So I'd best start out with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"&gt;what it is&lt;/a&gt;.
At a very basic level if we think about electrical wiring then you have the core wire that carries the signal and a coating that
prevents anything messing with that core wire, causing short circuits. This is kinda like nerves, you have the nerve and it has a sheath of something
called Myelin. In MS something causes the immune system to attack this Myelin sheath leaving the exposed nerve open to damage.
This can have (what I understand are) fairly random effects with varying levels of severity. There are also 2 types: relapsing remitting
and progressive. I have the former and don't ever want the latter, for further reading the &lt;a href="http://www.mstrust.org.uk/"&gt;MS Trust Website&lt;/a&gt; has proved fairly
invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's move onto how it's affected me. I've had a handful of relapses now although none have been what I'd call severe, none of
them have altered my lifestyle. Trying to pinpoint when it started is pretty difficult but for ages I had slightly less sensation
down the left hand side of my body and I also had tingling in my feet, legs and sometimes my torso when I looked down.
The tingling is known as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lhermitte's_sign"&gt;L'hermitte's sign&lt;/a&gt;, naturally I ignored it for ages!
When I did finally go to the doctor they sent me off for MRI scans of which I had 2 in Aberystywth and 1 in Swansea. The Swansea
machine is much, much nicer - the one in Aberystwyth was actually painful, the head cradle has pointy bits and I was once in it for 1.5 hours! I never
followed up the one in Swansea until September when I went to a GP in Oxford and they chased it, the GP suspected MS and referred me to a specialist. I've had a few other things too,
my eyesight in my right eye has gone blurry twice and I lost pretty much all skin sensation on my left leg once, each of these relapses
has only lasted a week or two. I can't remember if I've had anything else. To be fair I can live with loss of sensation, it's loss of use of limbs or the like that I'd rather
not ever get! Typically after a relapse the symptoms go away or at least do for the most part. Currently the only thing that I have
is that my finger tips have lost some sensation and that seems to be fairly permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onto the drugs, as I've had more than 2 relapses in a year I'm eligable for disease modifying medication. These drugs are meant
to reduce the number of relapses. The consultant told me that typically people have 3 relapses a year and with the drugs that
tend to drop to 2, given that the effect of a relapse seems pretty random reducing them seems like a good idea to me. The drug that I've chosen
is something called &lt;a href="http://www.mstrust.org.uk/atoz/betaferon.jsp"&gt;Betaferon&lt;/a&gt; of the Beta Interferon family. I'm not going to
pretend that I have a clue about what it does or that I really made an informed decision about which drug to use. My choice
was made on what I thought fitted my lifestyle/impacted upon it the least which is what I was told to make the decision on. Each drug has a nice list of side effects but the most
common for this one appears to be flu like symptoms for the first 3 months or so. My appointment to find out how to use the drugs
and my first injection is a week on Tuesday so I guess that Wednesday will be fairly revealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus far the nurses and doctors of John Radcliffe Hospital and DK Earley and Partners have been fantastic and explained everything really
well to me. No doubt I'll be seeing plenty more of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all that is certain is that the future is rather uncertain but, hell, whose isn't?! I'll continue to live my life as I always
have and deal with any obstacles as they happen, much like everyone else does...&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">chuck</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:chvck.co.uk,2013-01-07:posts/2013/Jan/07/lets-talk-ms/</guid><category>ms</category></item><item><title>Sebs Stag</title><link>chvck.co.uk/posts/2012/May/12/sebs-stag/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Saturday was Seb's stag do which was set to be go-karting, comedy club and a night out. I left home at around 9am bound
for Ben's place and from there we continued to &lt;a href="http://www.cannonraceway.co.uk/"&gt;Coseley Go karting&lt;/a&gt; (via a few wrong turns because Ben knew better
than the sign that said "Go Karting this way"). Yes, their website does have a video that starts playing loud music as soon
as you load the home page, no I do not know who thought that was a good idea. We managed to somehow arrive bang on time and met a few new faces
and saw a few old ones too. It had been a very long time since I had last seen Rob and Seb, about 2 years!
We wandered in and got suited up, registered etc... and George managed to turn up mid-briefing so we were all sorted and
ready to go. The karting consisted of 10 seeding laps followed by a 60 lap race. The karting was pretty good fun
and I was pretty surprised how much it made my arms hurt, drifting over the small bumps in the floor really, really
hurt! Unfortunately I had to pull off after about 20 laps (was in 4th at the time, out of 10) due to my back bneing in
agony. It's probably worth mentioning that I had a massive crash on my mtb Friday evening...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I'd pulled off I stood in the spectator area and watched everyone else. There were plently of spins and crashes and
quite a few diagonal flags were shown. This was the flag that signified that you were driving too recklessly and to
calm it down or you'd get pulled into the pits for a "chat". About 40 laps in I saw someone get the diagonal flag and then
hit someone else pretty hard mid-lap, sure enough they got the special yellow and orange checked flag and had to pull in.
Probably could have already guessed who it would be and the number 2 on the front confirmed my suspicion - it was Ben. Sadly for
him he was in first at the time! A few more uneventful laps and the race was over. Rob won with Seb in second place, Ben managed 6th despite
having been pulled into the pits! I, obviously, came in last!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karting over we headed into the centre of Birminham to the hotel. This took quite a while longer than planned too. Rob and
George were following us in the car behind and after driving for quite some time rang through to ask if we knew where
we were going because they thought that we'd passed where we wanted to turn off about 10 minutes before. At this point
we had to admit that no, we didn't have a clue! But, no harm done, we turned around and headed back int he right direction,
we parked up in the very busy multi-storey carpark next door to the travelodge for a pretty sum of Â£3 for 24 hours, can't
complain about that really - pretty good! Travelodge was as expected, a travelodge. We showered, changed etc... and headed
to Jimmy Spices. This place was an all you can eat buffet of a load of different cuisines. I tried quite a variety of
the food on offer and really enjoyed their butter chicken. Somehow, despite taking it easy, managed to eat too much
and felt pretty bloated for the next hour or so after, fairly typical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we'd been fed we headed toward the &lt;a href="http://www.thehighlight.co.uk/"&gt;Highlight&lt;/a&gt; comedy club via a pint or 2 in Spoons. We arrived in Highlight
to find that Paul had ordered the Stag package so we had a table right at the very front of the stage, could already
see the fear in Seb's eyes! We also had table service which we all cunningly managed to forget time and again. Ben bought
a 4 pint pitcher for the 2 of us and that did us for the duration of the time that we were in there. I'm not going to lie,
I can't remember the names of any of the comedians. Tell a lie I just remembed the compere was Rudi Lickwood. He was very good,
loads of laughs and kept coming back to pick on Seb a bit and tell him the woes of married life. The other comedians were also
very good including a sort of slap stick duo who had a very, very clever act. I was quite amazed at how little heckling there was,
anyone who tried pretty rapidly got shot down and made to look a fool by the act that was on at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the comedy club we headed to Gatecrasher, this was the part of the night that I hadn't been looking forward to so much!
Once we were in we went for a short walk to see what rooms etc... there were and wound up at a bar overlooking the main dancefloor.
We were quite quickly joined by a group of very skimpily dressed girls with very odd makeup and cans strapped to their heads. They
turned out to be the dancers, still no idea what the get-up was all about - very odd! Ben, Rob and I bought a round of JD and cokes each,
at 12 quid a round, 1 round was enough! At about 1am everyone headed to the dancefloor so George and I decided to head back
to the hotel, Gatecrasher wasn't really our scene, especially not the dancing part! Ben came back a while after us and then Rob
came in later on, Rob had come back with the others and somehow Paul had managed to get his phone stolen, he was rather drunk!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning we had a pretty average breakfast in the hotel but at least it was unlimited and had a coffee machine! Once we'd
eaten and grabbed our stuff we all said our goodbyes and headed off. Next time I'll see Seb will be his wedding in July I suspect.
All in all it was an enjoyable day, a bit pricey but I had fun and I'm pretty sure that Seb did too so job's a good'un!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">chuck</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 12 May 2012 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:chvck.co.uk,2012-05-12:posts/2012/May/12/sebs-stag/</guid><category>boozing</category></item><item><title>House hunting</title><link>chvck.co.uk/posts/2012/Apr/28/house-hunting/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This week I've spent Wednesday-Friday flat/house hunting for a place to rent for
when we move down to Oxford. I had about 7 places lined up to go look at over the 2.5
days which increased to 9 whilst I was down there. Tuesday night I drove down to Georges
where I would be staying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday I only had 2 bookings and in the morning that got reduced to 1 by an estate
agent bailing out. As George was feeling a bit crap I gave him a lift into Oxford to work which
was surprisingly easier than I had suspected it would be, I also ended up taking him in and picking
him up all 3 days! At midday I went to my first booking which was in Kennington which looked
to be a pretty good location for getting into Oxford, upon arriving I noticed that there
was also a pub pretty much the other side of the road, always a good thing! This flat was furnished
and was quite nice but incredibly small and on the second floor so the road bike would be a bit
of a hassle both to fit and get in. It was pretty much 2 rooms, a living area with the kitchen attached
and a bedroom with en-suite. At this point it's worth mentioning that Oxford prices are bloody
insane! I couldn't quite see how the price of this place was justified given the size of it, guess the price
reflected the location. I managed to get from the door of the property into the centre of Oxford, including
parking and getting on the p&amp;amp;r bus, within 15 minutes - not bad going! Naturally, being in Oxford, I had 2 burrito's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday I had 6 bookings lined up starting from 10am so I dropped George into work and headed back to Abingdon
and set off to the marina. This flat was in a nice development area and wasn't a bad sized flat (ground floor) with a communal
garden type area. I wasn't massively taken with it though unfortunately, the location was right at the bottom of Abingdon
so not as good for Oxford or the A34 as the other properties I had lined up. I can't even remember how this place
was laid out! After the viewing I followed the estate agent to my next viewing at the Vineyard flats. The next place
was also a second floor flat but once again a decent size. I was taken by the kitchen which was once
again joined to the living area but both areas were large and there was a nice breakfast bar as a kind of
separator. I mentally noted this place as worth keeping in mind. At this point I was pretty close to George's flat so headed back,
my next viewing was in the same development as his flat. I met the estate agent and it actually turned out to the be the next
door down from George! Another second floor flat and this one was quite small despite the agent keep saying
she was impressed with the size of it. I've forgotten what this one was like as I wasn't at all taken!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next 2 viewings were in Botley and I noticed that they were the most expensive ones I was viewing, I didn't book
these! First one was yet another second floor apartment and was OK but the kitchen was utterly tiny and had quite a
lot of road noise. For the price I was majorly unimpressed and getting a bit worried that I wasn't going to find anywhere.
After this viewing I had a thrilling time sat in the car for an hour waiting for my next viewing. This viewing
was an actual house which I quite interested by. Upon walking to the door I could tell it was going to be fairly small, the house
is on the end of a block and the door is actually round the side not on the front like the other houses! We walked in and
I was instantly impressed with the layout, kitchen was a decent size and quite nice and it had a downstairs toilet too! The
main living area was very nice and spacious and had wooden floors. There was a small conservatory which was nice and a private
garden area which was gravel and paved with a shed, A SHED, this one I could actually bring my mtb to! Upstairs had 2 bedrooms
and a bathroom which all looked alright. After a bried chat with the agent he said that a small cat wouldn't be a problem
and that for the right tenatnts the landlady was prepared to knock 70 quid a month off the advertised price. Bingo, this
was very much on my radar now! Quite ideal location too with good access to both A34 and Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I popped back to Abingdon for the last viewing of the day. This property was another house but I can't remember
much about it now, I wasn't very excited by it especially the lack of white goods. I went into Oxford a bit early to pick George up as i'd arranged a chat with One Ltd
just to say hi and discuss what they do etc... They were really, really nice and we had a good laugh too, hopefully
I'll bump into them at hack days, geek nights etc... Friday morning I popped George into Oxford and headed back to Abingdon for
my final viewing, this was a ground floor flat and was quite big. Massive joint area for the main living space and
kitchen. 2 bedrooms, en-suite and a main bathroom. I decided that this would be a good backup flat as I wanted to try
get the one in Botley. I rang the agent and told him that we wanted it but he told me that there was another viewing
in the afternoon and that the landlady wanted to honour it, fair enough. I packed mine and George's stuff into the car
and headed off. I was at the farm when Maura called me to say that the landlady wanted the weekend to consider who
to take on as the other party who viewing had expressed an interest, made me nervous! In the evening I popped to the
lime kiln with Ben and drank about 4 pints more than planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I woke up feeling groggy but with a text from Maura saying that we had the property! I rang the agent
and got the fees paid straight away. So we're now sorted so long as we pass all the various checks that
the agents run on us. All very exciting and had to try to think of a way to find some furniture and hope Maura
gets a job in Oxford pretty quickly as we're going to be Ok but a bit low on spare cash otherwise. Whilst on the farm I also
took a look at the array of solar panels that Dad had installed on one of the sheds, pretty cool! Here's a picture of the shed
at the house we're hopefully going to be renting! I will be fortifying it A LOT.&lt;/p&gt;
