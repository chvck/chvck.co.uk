    <h2><a href="../../../../../posts/2013/Jan/13/bens-aber-weekend/">Ben's Aber Weekend</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 13 Jan 2013</h3>
        
      <p>Last Monday was Ben's birthday so he organised a trip to Aberystwyth with plenty of riding involved. Plan being to ride
Nant-y-arian on Saturday and then something suitable to hangover states on Sunday. I went to Rich's house on Friday night
as Saturday morning was to be an early start. At Rich's we did a night ride in the Lickey Hills which were muddy but good
fun. I started out with my light attached to my helmet but it pretty quickly became evident that the level of fog around was
not ideal for a helmet light so switched it over to my bars which was much better. The light is a tad spotty but is generally
really good and there was plenty of light for me to see by. Definitely going to have to ride those trails in the dry!</p>
<p>Saturday, we made our way to Ben's, loaded up his van and set off to nant. We were running late but that was OK as the other
guys were running later (expect the other Ben who, as always, was punctual). There were Ben, Ben, Rich, Taylor, Rab, Jase,
Pete and myself. I'd never met Pete before but had been to the alps with Rab and Jase.</p>
<p><img alt="Vans" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-o-AjCano134/UPchd6ToroI/AAAAAAAABbo/fpMKYJj1GjA/s640/IMG_20130112_115846.jpg" /></p>
<p>Anyway, once we'd sorted ourselves out
we set out on a Summit + extras loop. The extras we threw in were White Fridge and a few did Reaper, I went off in hunt of another
track that I've done before but wound up riding down a steep, rocky track until I bumped into Zorro and did the bottom half of that.
Nant was, as always, a blast and I felt pretty good, although slow, on the climbs too. As a first I also took a hip flask on the
ride, filled with port. Why had I never done that before?! It was a great idea!</p>
<p><img alt="Sending it" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/734841_10151624410798765_255312670_n.jpg" /></p>
<p>We headed to the Tiddly Widdly for a pint before going to aber and at this point said bye to Ben and Taylor.</p>
<p><img alt="Pint" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/309668_10151624416393765_1474277726_n.jpg" /></p>
<p>After we got back and got the keys to our rooms in Maes y mor we showered etc... and set off to Lopburi for food. Lopburi was
good as per usual, I had the jungle curry - tasty. After that we headed to spoons for coffeebucas. That was a bit of a warning
sign that it was going to be a bit of a drunken night. We hit several pubs before venturing into pier pressure. That place
has not improved although it has got stickier. I'm pretty sure that it hasn't changed since we were at uni, even the drinks are the
same - just more expensive. At about 2 Jase, Rab and Pete headed off; I decided to stay with Rich and Ben but I quickly decided
to leave too. Unfortunately it was midway back to the guest house that I realised Rich had the key and my phone was dead, no matter
I just went for a short walk and then sat against a wall for a while - it was quite warm out. We'll certainly be using Maes y mor again.</p>
<p>Sunday, we all woke up quite late and after paying for the rooms and having breakfast we managed to get into the vans about 12ish.
We headed up to nant again but this time parked up near white fridge so that we could go out the top and do some of the conti
loop and up into anglers retreat. I felt much better climbing than on Saturday, not really sure why - possibly the lack of
drinking port on the ride. We went out on a normal conti loop but cut out the loop to the reservoir and back as we'd do the good
descent there later on. We stopped 3/4 down Bont Goch and did the descent there, it was pretty wildly cut up and fairly
hard to predict what was coming up!</p>
<p><img alt="Bont goch" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/226670_10151624428393765_1109049718_n.jpg" /></p>
<p>After that was the long old climb that goes on and on! We did the techy climb followed by descending
the slab which was ace. After that we headed back to the conti loop and rode it backward to get back to nant. We chose to skip
hippity hop in favour of doing white fridge whilst there was still light. It was a fantastic ride although majorly cold. I also
made the choice of going through every water obstacle - that didn't make it any warmer and several times I was in upto my axles!</p>
<p>After that was home time, 4 hours back to Aberystwyth! It was a great weekend and I'm looking forward to the Dyfi warmup for
more!</p>
