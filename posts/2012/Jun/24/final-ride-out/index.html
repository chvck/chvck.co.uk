    <h2><a href="../../../../.././posts/2012/Jun/24/final-ride-out/">Final Ride Out</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 24 Jun 2012</h3>
        
      <p>The move is almost upon us and I decided that I wanted one last long ride. So I decided that for
old times sake a ride out was in order, no real plan - just ride up to nant and do whatever. Ben H asked if
he could tag along too, he didn't quite realise that i was going for a bit of a long one at the time though!
Anyway, Sunday morning rolled round and Ben arrive around 10.30, we waited for the episode of True Blood (yeah, I know)
I was watching to finish and then headed out, the weather was good - cloudy but not wet and it was a nice temperature too.
I had organised my thoughts into which way to get up to Nant so we headed out on the A44 until the road that
leads off and climbs up to the Waunfawr - Capel Dewi road. We went along that and continued to Capel Dewi before heading on
up to Nant through Banc-y-darren.</p>
<p>Once up Nant we headed down Zorro and played the no pedal game, always a fun one! Once down we had a spot of lunch
before heading up the leg burner. About halfway up we came across the landslide that I'd heard about. Wow, wasn't expecting
that much damage:</p>
<p><img alt="Landslide" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oNy9qYlbf_s/T-d7UKs9mUI/AAAAAAAABJU/Nfdd44AeV0Y/s400/IMG_20120624_122237.jpg" />
<img alt="Landslide" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Kx6Pwq2Yx68/T-d73T4VjMI/AAAAAAAABJ0/yxYw8ZWaWWI/s400/IMG_20120624_122335.jpg" />
<img alt="Landslide" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rlq3kGiwWwo/T-d66UTqGcI/AAAAAAAABJE/kYEuXXkC5WM/s400/IMG_20120624_122301.jpg" /></p>
<p>I'm not even sure that stream was there before and if it was then it certainly wasn't as open as it is now. Pretty
incredible what water can do! Once we'd finished marvelling at the landslide we carried on up and over to Hippity Hop then
Drunken Druid. At this point we turned off and went through the gate to do a rather rocky descent that I hadn't done in
a while. Wow, water had taken its toll here too, some bits were more like riding trials than a descent - it was
pretty wild! At this point I decided that we'd head out on Joe's Back Garden and hit an obstacle...a stream that
was just a little higher than normal:</p>
<p><img alt="Stream" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Z-PRCQSdk7Y/T-d7pNCTuOI/AAAAAAAABJk/ZbbVt_ZMLzo/s400/IMG_20120624_132029.jpg" />
<img alt="Stream" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-BQadexuNr3E/T-d8U3omc3I/AAAAAAAABKg/ix6x9qiDRbY/s400/IMG_20120624_132036.jpg" /></p>
<p>We found a place to leap over and continued out along the stream bed which actually had a stream in it and was rather rutted
and rocky. Once on the road we went over to the resevoir and over the dam before going round to link back up with the
Conti trail and continued along that. The puddles on the inward part from the resevoir were ridiculously high and the mx-ers
have made a right mess of the banks going around them. The first descent on that part is also rather wild now and really good fun!
The Bont Goch climb hasn't recovered since the last time I went up there and is still very scarred from the water with a fairly
decent sized stream running down it in a massive rut! Once up the top of the climb we took the bridleway down instead
of the Bont Goch descent, just for something a bit different!</p>
<p>We continued along the road and then followed the Conti loop back to nant. By the time we popped out up the top
of Hippity Hop we were both feeling the distance in our legs and decided to do Hippity Hop and then head back home via White Fridge.
At the bottom of White Fridge I decided to take my rear brake pads out to have a look at why they were making such an odd noise. Yeah,
no pad left and rubbing metal on metal, that old one! Unfortunately the spring was also utterly dead and so I couldn't fit the pads
back in, luckily the only downhill we had left was on the road so a front brake only would suffice. We descended down to
Penrhyncoch before climbing back up to Capel Dewi along the little back road, Ben was off and pushing this point and I was
feeling knackered! Neither of us fancied climbing up the Capel Dewi to Waunfawr road so we decided to return via the roundabout just
out of town.</p>
<p>All in all a nice ride with good weather. Certainly a great ride to remember the area by with some great views. Going
to miss these hills!</p>
