a lock ring getting rounded. I took this as a sign that it was time for new grips
in my new colour scheme. I decided to give the superstar excel grips a go, went for
yellow cartridges (replacable too) with green lock rings; they also come with black
end caps. They arrived today and on first impressions they look good. The compound is soft
and they feel really grippy and nice n fat. They're also really, really long! The colours
are pretty vibrant and they look nice, the photo doesn't really do them justice on the vibrancy. 
For a tenner I think that they might be a bit of a steal,
time will tell how well they get on, the Oury's are going into the toolbox as spares just in
case. Only negative thing I can say is that I didn't get any Haribo with my order!&lt;/p&gt;
