    <h2><a href="../../../../.././posts/2012/Jun/09/mach-n-back/">Mach n Back</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 09 Jun 2012</h3>
        
      <p>The time for us to leave Aberystwyth is rapidly approaching. Ben and I wanted to do a 100km
mtb ride before that time arises so using the <a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/chvck/activity/77580855">Mach &amp; back route that I did with Dave Reed and
the Ystwyth gang</a> I plotted a new route adding in
some different bits to get the distance up. The basic difference was to be that we'd kick out further on the way out
by going further along the
Conti loop doing most of the Bont Goch descent before doubling back on the rocky descent and then doing the long
slog of a climb up to Anglers. Then on the way back we'd climb up to the Bont Goch descent again but take the bridleway
down and then come back to Nant along the usual Conti Loop and do a Summit loop too. Oh, we also parked in the forestry
car park outside of nant so that would add a reasonable amount of distance too.</p>
<p>Now the days running up to this were wet to say the least. Friday saw the beginning of flooding in the area but Saturday was
due to be sunny all day. The morning came round and it was wet but the rain had stopped. <a href="http://www.cambrian-news.co.uk/news/i/24955/">A quick look online showed
massive flooding in the area</a> but we decided to go out anyway and
got to the forestry car park at about 10.30. It wasn't exactly nice out and getting out of the van I stepped into a stream that
had never been there before! I wasn't feeling stoked at this point:</p>
<p><img alt="Me not looking best impressed" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Ksi_Wky28HI/T9SHag6SJsI/AAAAAAAAAvo/gmpIkUKcPOA/s640/P1010171.jpg" /></p>
<p>We trundled over toward Nant and got to the bottom of the Pendam climb that pops us up near the base of Hippity Hop.
Wow! There was an unreal amount of water flowing down the track and the stream nearby was completely white and very
rapid. Climbing up this bit of the climb there was a constant rut that went to about 3 foot deep in places - utterly, utterly
crazy. The photo below shows the water streaming down the track, never seen it like that before. We thought that this was
a lot of water, little did we know...</p>
<p><img alt="Water!" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NGZ2TjGFNCA/T9SHdooujlI/AAAAAAAAAv4/98JSw5wcPhg/s640/P1010172.jpg" /></p>
<p>Onward we went and kicked out onto the Conti trail, as soon as we came across the first lake we noticed that it was ridiculously high
with water everywhere.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-c_iRkvSdqR8/T9SHbt94nOI/AAAAAAAAAvs/TMSkWi8cDgk/s640/P1010173.jpg" />
<img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rq8BoxXuW4Y/T9SHhtxALhI/AAAAAAAAAwA/z9IacXJl06U/s640/P1010174.jpg" /></p>
<p>At this point a Forestry Commission 4x4 came along and we had a brief chat with the guy who told us that
Nant-y-moch resevoir had received 10 inches of water the previous day and that they were struggling to stop
the dam from overflowing! The epicness of this ride was rising pretty rapidly! Onward we went until we hit the first
bit of a river crossing which has a bridge. The path to the bridge itself was flooded and we had to find a bit of an alternate line
to it but the path away from the bridge was flooded in all directions and we had to jump the fence and trudge through
a bit of shallow bog to get back to the path. Unreal!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GADXEstLmPM/T9SHimAAlGI/AAAAAAAAAwE/RoEL8L_jVyQ/s512/P1010176.jpg" />

<p>We decided that we'd continue on the route that I had planned which cut off the Conti trail at this point onto a bit
of track that I'd done before with the Ystwyth guys, a fair amount of this track was now a stream but rideable! We continued on
and did the ridiculous grass descent down to the resevoir where the Conti loop joins. Ben managed to hit a tuft of grass and have
a bit of a comical off too. Back on the Conti trail we rode the bit that leads to the resevoir backward and we'd then cross another
stream and cut down to where one of the Conti trails descends to from the resevoir (we'd do this descent later). First major issue of the day!
As we approached the stream we could see a group of motocrossers stood about and as we passed them one was walking back toward us. His sole comment
was "Good luck with that", I didn't think much of it and figured that we'd find a way across. Uh, no. The stream was way, way
too high to get across and despite back tracking down the river for a while we couldn't find anywhere to cross. We bikehiked back across directly to the trail
that we'd just come along and rode back along it and started following the Conti trail the correct way again.</p>
<p>I was expecting the puddles in this section to be quite bad but they looked deep enough that we decided to skirt around
the sides of all of them. We hit the descent and it was pretty wild, streams running down it everywhere and big rocks all over
the place. Just as we got to toward the end we overtook 2 of the motocrossers we'd seen earlier, putting us down a really crap line
with a lot of water running down it and some big, sketchy looking rocks. No matter we made it down fine. At this point
we had to wait aaaages for the motocrossers to get up the start of the climb to the Bont Goch descent, they were taking forever. In the end
we just gave up and passed them, not often you overtake crossers going uphill!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Ij4ocpbrBOo/T9SH1Squ_sI/AAAAAAAAAxE/s8gPppyNhBQ/s640/P1010182.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Bont Goch descent itself was really, really hard work with a stream running down it and massive rocks all over the place. Most of
the previous lines that i knew were totally gone. The rocky descent just off the Bont Goch descent was just as bad with line choice being
pretty key to not either going down a hole or smacking into a big rock. We got down unscathed and started on the long climb
up to Anglers Retreat, the start of this road was underwater too (below) but the actual fireroad was fine and there was
even a bit of sun starting to show! At the top of this climb there's usually a stream crossing followed by a short, sharp technical
climb. We had a brief discussion and decided that the stream crossing would likely be uncrossable so skirted around that section
on the road...into the wind which was really starting to pick up now! We continued on up the fireroad to the start of the next descent which
actually started off fairly dry but I felt that sudden feeling that the rear of the bike felt dead. Rear tyre totally flat.
Quick swapping of tubes and we were off again, following the standard set so far this descent was also soaking but most of the lines had stayed intact.</p>

<p>Next up was the bit that links Anglers to the Mach 3, I'd only done this once before but we picked it up easily enough and
skirted around a couple of puddles before hitting a stream crossing. This was completely and utterly unpassable. It was very deep
and looked really fast. Quick look at the OS map and we decided to head back up to the start of the previous descent and pick up
a fireroad there. Once we got to the point that marks the start of that previous descent we stopped for a bit of lunch and
decided that we'd head back to Nant as we didn't know if we'd actually be able to get to Mach and it was getting to be fairly late
already. The usual way back has a deep crossing that we decided wouldn't be a good idea so we picked up the road and headed back that way
before picking up the Conti loop backward again and riding the same bit of trail for the third time! What really struck
us at this point was that the water level had gone down loads. We actually make it across the afore-mentioned bridge with
no problems and even the lake had gone down a fair bit.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-VdbnhOPkjj8/T9SINyROoLI/AAAAAAAAAyA/B4pb8G65qwM/s640/P1010189.jpg" />

<p>Once back at Nant we picked up the Summit loop and did Hippity Hop, Drunken Druid and High as a Kite before a brief break at the visitors
centre. We left off from there and headed up to the Italian Job and saw a sign stating that the Summit trail was closed due to a landslide,
this we later learnt was on the leg burner, a section had collapsed. We had no intentions of going down toward the bottom end of the
trail anyway so pushed on and did Italian Job and Hippity Hop. All of the Summit trails that we did were running fine and felt good
as usual. We did the really eroded climb from earlier backward which was pretty wild in bits and continued on to and did the top
of White Fridge which was also ace before heading back to the van.</p>
<p>Ace ride that despite not getting us either Mach and back or 100km was great fun, a bit of an adventure and 60km! Thanks
to Ben for the photos.</p>
