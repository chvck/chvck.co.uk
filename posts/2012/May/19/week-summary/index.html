    <h2><a href="http://chvck.co.uk/posts/2012/May/19/week-summary/">Week Summary</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 19 May 2012</h3>
        
      <p>In the past week I've managed to get out on the mountain bike 3 times which isn't bad really! On Sunday
Ben and I drove to Rich's place after leaving the hotel from Seb's stag do. We spent quite a lot of time tinkering with
bikes and for once we didn't have to tinker with mine! We headed to the Wyre Forest, somewhere that I'd not been before.
After a bacon sandwich from the cafe we set off riding, this place reminded me quite a lot of Swinley Forest. The surface
was quite sandy and I could hear my drivetrain grinding as we were riding round. It was quite an enjoyable little blast,
none of the hills were particularly big but there were lots of short little descents and climbs which was quite fun. A few steep bits
but for the most part it was just flat out with very little tech, which suited me having had a few beers the night before. Ben
managed to have a pretty decent sized crash off the side of one of the trails that saw his bike go pinwheeling off down the
side of the hill but he was OK. Pretty fun place, good singletrack! Once again we managed to resemble a Cotic fanclub as
the image below shows!</p>

<p>The other two rides I've done this week have both been up Nant-y-arian. Wednesday night I popped up with Andy and
we did the usual Ystwyth loop, climbing up to Hippity Hop car park, doing the Summit loop and then back via White Fridge, my
favourite loop! It was a pretty uneventful ride but, as ever, top fun. I played the no pedal game down most of the descents
as I'm trying to develop my skills to gain speed from the trail and try to brake less. We managed to get round the 25km in just
under 2 hours which we were pretty happy with, we didn't ride especially quick we just didn't take any breaks. The other ride we
did on Friday night, again with Andy but this time with Tom too. We started at Hippity Hop and just did a standard Summit loop.
For some reason this was a really, really fun ride. We took our time (16km in just over 2 hours) and just generally messed about.
Following Andy really is great fun, he jumps off loads of little things and is very stylish to watch. Taking his lines and
trying to do all the little jumps that he does is ace! That boy really is rather good on a bike. We had a bit of a mechanical
midway up the leg burner when Tom's chain went bang but other than that it was fairly plain sailing.</p>

<p>Also this week I've playing with nodejs for work. I'm pretty impressed, using the express framework I've managed to knock
something together for our platform pretty quickly and easily! I'm also very much loving using javascript on both the back and
front end. As a part of this I've also been learning to use Jade templates, this has meant no static pages and each page generated
on the fly. This has also enabled me to do some pretty funky stuff although unfortunately can't really go into detail.
I do have 1 tip for using couchdb. If you want to access it from anywhere that isn't localhost then you need to go into the
local config file and change the bindings to 0.0.0.0 from 127.0.0.1, this may be a little less secure as it opens couchdb up to
requests from any interface but it took me about 2 hours of trying to get a proxy to use work before finding that out! I also
wound up using this nodejs proxy server that is pretty simple and works: <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/http-proxy-in-nodejs/">http://www.catonmat.net/http-proxy-in-nodejs/</a></p>
