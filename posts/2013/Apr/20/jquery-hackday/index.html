    <h2><a href="chvck.co.uk/posts/2013/Apr/20/jquery-hackday/">JQuery Hackday</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 20 Apr 2013</h3>
        
      <p>Yesterday marked the <a href="http://events.jquery.org/2013/uk/">Jquery UK</a> conference 
which was hosted by <a href="http://www.whiteoctober.co.uk/">White October</a> in Oxford.
Unfortunately I didn't go to the conference but today they also hosted a hackday
along with <a href="http://jsoxford.com/">JS Oxford</a> which I did make it to! The idea for the 
hackday was to have remote control cars that we could control from our laptops, phones etc...
but also control using javascript run under nodejs.</p>
<p><img alt="The car" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-43up7VqMoro/UXQmzkJGetI/AAAAAAAACMA/YdxAlpSadaw/s640/IMG_20130420_114428.jpg" />
<p class="caption">The car!</p></p>
<p>I arrived at about 8.45 and by 9 was sat on a table with 2 others and starting to hack.
I'd already managed to install something called <a href="https://github.com/chrisjameskirkham/libkoki">libkoki</a> which we used for some machine 
vision stuff but unfortunately had the wrong version of node installed to build the node 
bindings for it that the White October guys had written for us. 2 versions of node later
and I had it working along with being able to run code on the car, pretty exciting stuff!</p>
<p>I was on a team with 3 others - Sunil, Phil and Toby. We were using the Blackberry sponsored
car for the day. There were no real restrictions on what
we could do with the day and with the cars although there was mention of a race at the end
of the day. As we all had the koki stuff working we decided that we'd try to navigate around 
the race track using that, going from marker to marker. Libkoki is a library used in
<a href="https://www.studentrobotics.org/">student robotics</a> competitions. The idea behind it is that
there are a number of markers that the library can detect and extract some static and some
dynamic information from using a live camera feed. The markers provide information such
as which number in a series it is as well as distance from the camera, rotation etc....</p>
<p><img alt="Koki marker" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jTCkMUftkDY/UXQm_VoSD3I/AAAAAAAACMQ/t_zHFV6-t0Y/s640/IMG_20130420_155934.jpg" />
<p class="caption">One of the koki markers</p></p>
<p><img alt="The track" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-lf6sZbv3bCA/UXQnC1hCpJI/AAAAAAAACMY/voDDL5gGjVw/s640/IMG_20130420_155940.jpg" />
<p class="caption">The track</p></p>
<p>The koki markers on the inside of the track were even numbered ones and on the outside odd.
We decided to use a pretty simple approach of just turning anti-clockwise when we detected and
got close to an even marker, and the opposite with an odd marker. I had tried to write a bit of logic
to avoid hitting walls by using the angle of the car to the marker to work out the distance
to the wall that the marker was on. I have a feeling that the value that I was using from the marker information
wasn't actually the angle that I thought it was and this approach was never going to work if we didn't
have a marker in sight anyway! </p>
<p>Now, in my masters I did quite a lot of work navigating a maze with a rover but for that
I used sonar. Whilst the sonar that I used back then was quite noisy it was still
remarkably easier than using a live camera feed! If your vehicle is sat in front of a wall
that's 20cm away then that's pretty easy to tell with sonar, not so much with a camera. Whilst
we did have koki at our disposal that only worked if a marker was in sight, which 20cm from a wall
quite often is not the case. I was pretty shocked by just how hard dealing with no
extra information such as that given by sonar was, certainly made it interesting.</p>
<p>Anyway, over the day our approach slowly developed (and our car hit many, many walls - they were
only made from cardboard, luckily) and by the end we were bouncing between markers and working
round the track relatively well, I think that we even managed half the track at one point.
By the end of the day there was only one other team left and they had used an approach
of edge detection on the tops of the walls. Their car was quite good at navigating some bits
but not so good at other sections. In the end there was a race but the cars were controlled by
people on phones instead!</p>

<p>It was an excellent day and I had a lot of fun. If they ever put on another then I'll
definitely try to be there. Big thanks to the guys who set it all up so that we could
do what we did.</p>
