I haven't had much of a play with it yet as I don't yet have a micro sim, I kind of overlooked that small detail. Luckily
one of the guys at work has a cutter and is bringing it in tomorrow. I've setup my Google account on it and whacked
it on our wifi. So far it seems great, I really like the latest versions of Android anyway. The build quality is more
than just a little better than my Wildfire, it feels solid and has a nice weight to it. It's also rather noticably faster.
I haven't tried the camera on it yet but will be doing so for tomorrows photo - here's hoping it's better than the one on
the Wildfire! As of tomorrow the Wildfire is going to Maura. Should also be interesting to see the battery life.&lt;/p&gt;

I've tried this for the past 2 years and just failed so this year I'm going to attempt
to write a short blog post about each photo to try to make myself think about what my photo will be.
Hopefully, this year I'll actually manage to do it!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="random"></category><category term="photo-a-day-2013"></category></entry><entry><title>Photo a day 1st Jan</title><link href="chvck.co.uk/posts/2013/Jan/01/photo-a-day-1st-jan/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>chuck</name></author><id>tag:chvck.co.uk,2013-01-01:posts/2013/Jan/01/photo-a-day-1st-jan/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bikes. Since moving to Oxford I have done little on the biking front and this year I would very much like to
rectify that. I've reached out to a local MTB club to see how I go about joining them for rides and I'm
going to try to spend more time on the turbo to improve my general cardio. I should note that this is not
a new years resolution, I believe that making those is just setting yourself up to fail. As of next week I'm
going to have to pack in booze for the most part for medical reasons so getting back on the bike now seems like
an ideal time. Put in the effort now it'll be worth it for Summer!&lt;/p&gt;
