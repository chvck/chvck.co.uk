</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>This weekend I'm back on the farm and so we planned a ride over at <a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/website/recreation.nsf/LUWebDocsByKey/EnglandHerefordshireTheMarchesEastridge">Eastridge to do the XC loop</a>.
It's worth mentioning at this point that Ben and I did a 50 mile road loop up to, around and back
from Lake Vyrnwy. It was pretty nice but the SPDs caused a lot of pain behind my right knee which was
still very sore today. Anyway, earlier in the week I looked at the length of Eastridge XC loop and it
turned out to be 8km, rather short and probably a 2 lap job!</p>
<p>We turned up to the carpark and waited about an hour for Bean, standard really. The loop took
us 2 hours! 8km took us 2 hours! This was a mixture of my leg hurting a lot and Bean taking
ages to repair his snapped chain, this was Ok though there was a little double just next to
where he snapped it so I played on that trying to clear it for a while, managed it in the end!
The Eastridge XC loop is pretty damn good, OK it is short BUT it's pretty much all singletrack with
no fireroad so it's pretty demanding and definitely not an easy course. Really, really good fun though and
will certainly be going back there, hopefully next time we'll get in 2 loops and there are also the old DH tracks so
plently of stuff to play about on too.</p>
