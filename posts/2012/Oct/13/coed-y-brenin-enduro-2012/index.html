    <h2><a href="../../../../.././posts/2012/Oct/13/coed-y-brenin-enduro-2012/">Coed-y-brenin Enduro 2012</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 13 Oct 2012</h3>
        
      <p>So, Friday I hitched a lift up to Coedy with Jimbo and Richard (who I hadn't met before) to meet up with Ben,
Jimbo and Richard were staying in a nearby B&amp;B but I opted for the cheaper option of Bens van. The drive up went well
and traffic was good, once in Dolgellau Ben and I grabbed some food at a pub which was also pretty good! We headed
 back to the campsite and it was pretty dead so we just grabbed a couple of beers before heading to sleep. 
The night in Bens van was pretty cold but all things equal was fairly comfortable. By the time we got up cars were
slowly arriving and by 10 the place was packed. Race plates fitted, breakfast eaten, bikes put together, riding time!</p>
<p>Everyone gathered for the race briefing and there was about 250 of us in total. Briefing over and off we went,
Ben and I had decided to stick together and take it easy, Jimbo went roaring off ahead of us. We rode with some of
the abermtb guys for quite a while during various sections too. The climbs were often long but just fire roads so
just grinding up wasn't so bad, although by the end they were making me feel pain somewhat.</p>
<p>The good - some of the off piste descents were truely cracking, steep and due to it being wet very muddy. Really,
really good fun those were, some flowly singletrack too. Everyone on the day were really nice and most people pulled
 over to let us pass on the descents. We ended up bumping into 3 guys from Birmingham quite a bit and they were an
excellent laugh, could hear them a mile off! Unfortunately I did go OTB in front of them which was a tad
embarrassing but nothing was hurt bar my pride. Some of the actual trail centre descents were also pretty good fun,
 what i believe is the final descent on the trail centre of the road was a hoot. Also, the food station was cracking!</p>
<p>The bad - To be fair at the time I thought that there was a lot of bad but realistically not that much sticks in my
mind. There was a section that was a long old climb through fields and really bad muddy wooded bits. In all fairness
to the course designers the rain didn't help and from what I've heard they couldn't link everything up without it. We
 had a brief chat with some marshalls and they said that not even the top guys managed to ride the wet grass bits.
Other than that bit not a lot sticks in my mind as being bad except...</p>
<p>The ugly - After the final descent of the trail centre side of the road we crossed over to the Tarw side. This I did
not enjoy, by this point I was pretty tired and just wanted to finish, what actually happened was another 15km or so
of riding round the Tarw trail with a few big old fireroad climbs. The descents were roughy and rocky so were hard
work as I was already pretty knackered. Had I been less tired I think that the descents would have actually been
cracking. Also worth going in the ugly is that Ben had 4 punctures, he used up not only all his spare tubes but mine
too!</p>
<p>Overall, I really do not know if I'll do it again, at the time had you asked me then I most certainly would have said
 no but I'm not sure. I think that next year I really need to work on my fitness as that would go a long way to
helping enjoy it. It was much, much harder than the Dyfi enduro which I had not expected. End of the day though it
was a day riding bikes in Wales so can't be that bad!</p>
<p>Position - 254th out of 269 overall, 134th out of 140 in category, Duration 7hr 46min 29sec. All you can do is laugh!</p>
