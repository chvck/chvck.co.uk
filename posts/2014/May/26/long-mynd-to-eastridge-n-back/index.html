    <h2><a href="http://chvck.co.uk/posts/2014/May/26/long-mynd-to-eastridge-n-back/">Long Mynd to Eastridge n back</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 26 May 2014</h3>
        
      <p>A couple of years ago I designed a route to do from the Long Mynd to Eastridge and back.
Unfortunately on the day that I was due to ride it I was ill, however the Bens and Rich
did. I quite fancied having a go at it but wanted to throw the Stiperstones into the mix
as well. I did a bit of hunting and <a href="http://www.mbswindon.co.uk/ride-long-mynd-eastridge-hopton/">found a loop that the mbswindon guys did</a>,
I threw this at Ben who did a few modifations using his local knowledge. The result of the plotting was a 55km loop with
around 1600m of climbing. </p>
<p>I met Ben at the shop at Marshbrook on Sunday at 10.45am, the weather was on/off rain so getting soaked was on the agenda. 
Standard faff and off we went. </p>
<p><img alt="The shop" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7KXRKJJp3ek/U4JKtBWA78I/AAAAAAAAEY4/mm42GuQXktY/s640/P1000612.JPG" /></p>
<p>We started out with the forestry climb and did half of the descent that i only know as the "south side descent". 
We only did half as Ben had described the climb back up if we did the whole run and neither of us
were stoked on the idea (long, grass climb). The half of the descent was pretty good fun - lots of whoops but overhanging
trees resulted in both of us getting pretty soaked down our right hand sides. </p>
<p><img alt="Wet!" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A03g8wFbfZo/U4JKr2nk53I/AAAAAAAAEYw/nThMbK3yw1U/s640/P1000613.JPG" /></p>
<p>We climbed back up to the top and
headed off down zigzags. I hadn't done that descent for ages and forgot how brilliant it is.</p>
<p>We worked our way over to Bridges, via the bridleway for the most-part, where we decided to take a break for some food before climbing
up the stiperstones. </p>
<p><img alt="Random statue thing" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AJRdDKHIfq0/U4JLQR85ZUI/AAAAAAAAEZU/wbwKuSzBGX8/s640/P1000617.JPG" />
<img alt="The Horseshoe Inn" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MHYrutC2Obw/U4JLf2U9ICI/AAAAAAAAEZc/Wex7UyXig_g/s640/P1000618.JPG" /></p>
<p>The first part of the climb was a 20% road but it wasn't too long and the climb got a bit easier after that.
After a while we dropped off the road and onto surfaced bridleway which became a grass field climb. We wound up
in the wrong field so some walking and navigation was involved here... Once we were back on track we pretty quickly popped up onto
the ridge and the top of our descent down. The descent was pretty rad! It was mostly rocky and the top was quite technical with a couple
of pretty interesting features. It pissed down for the entire descent but stopped as soon as we reached the bottom, which was nice!</p>
<p><img alt="Stiperstones getting closer" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jaS0VBABou4/U4JLqFFpVGI/AAAAAAAAEZo/-j8mdY1FL-M/s640/P1000620.JPG" />
<img alt="Top of the stiperstones descent" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-LwIVLY55BAE/U4JMvp3jjII/AAAAAAAAEas/monmi01TzyY/s640/P1000628.JPG" />
<img alt="Hill? No problem" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-b9ltZG4zNoU/U4JM601_V8I/AAAAAAAAEa0/jcayRMlshIg/s640/P1000629.JPG" /></p>
<p>We followed the road to Snailbeach and, once we worked out where to go, cracked on upto Easty. A hurrendous road climb saw us
enter the forest on a trail which popped us out at the top of topography. Ben hadn't been up there for a while and the only
descent what I hadn't done from there was the red so we decided to do that. I wasn't sure what to expect but what we rode wasn't
what I was expecting. It was really, really good. Lots of steep, sharp corners and really good fun. A step up in difficulty from
the black IMO! After that we cracked on and did a pretty standard loop to the car park. Eastridge is like night and day when it comes 
to riding it in the dry against the wet.</p>
<p><img alt="Red descent" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oqWZXnHW28A/U4JNOZAB21I/AAAAAAAAEa8/3Q46Rv6bdJA/s640/P1000630.JPG" />

<p>We picked up the fireroad up to the nearby farm and then skirted round on a bridleway which dropped us into Brook's Coppice (we got a bit lost 
here as well...). We followed this bridleway to the road which we stayed on to Bridges. Food stop again and then the road climb up the Mynd. 
This climb was loooong but not too steep and had some good views. </p>
<p><img alt="View off the climb" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-l-R3I7dwtcc/U4JN5s9K_bI/AAAAAAAAEbc/B7Mhno0p6yk/s640/P1000633.JPG" /></p>
<p>We split off and rode on up to the trig point before rejoining the road the other side of the peak.
All that we had left to ride was Mynton Batch, by this point I was pretty shafted and my legs weren't keen. Oh, and it'd become a small river
with all of the rain. We swiftly decided to crack on and get back to the cars. I spent most of the descent sat down, just too tired!</p>
<p><img alt="View from the trig point" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lFOS5HVmfNY/U4JN3PggnEI/AAAAAAAAEbU/bf9331o0bmE/s640/P1000634.JPG" /></p>
<p>We got back to the cars, showered (being able to shower straight after a ride is brilliant) and went our separate ways. Brilliant ride
that was pretty hard going but certainly worth doing. Will be going on my list of rides to again although not unless it's a nice day
next time. My garmin has it at 56.59km with 1796m of climing, not bad going for a rainy Sunday! <a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/chvck/activity/361113443">You can see the route here</a>.</p>
