    <h2><a href="../../../../../posts/2012/Aug/30/the-alps/">The Alps</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 30 Aug 2012</h3>
        
      <p>Destination: Morzine. This trip had been in the pipeline for a fair few months
and I was looking forward to it. We were due to fly out on Saturday 4th.
George had kindly agreed to drive us to and from Heathrow on the Saturday in his parents' estate.
Ben and Taylor arrived at my place on the Friday night to get bikes sorted and generally get ready for
packing in the morning and getting to the airport. About 10 minutes after arriving Ben
realised that he'd forgotten his passport... he wasn't best pleased about that. He went home
to get it (2 hours to get here and then straight back again!) and decided to come back in the morning
after sleeping.</p>
<p>Saturday morning, all kit ready to go and car packing time. So, 3 bikes in bike bags don't fit
in a Mondeo estate. Problem. In the end we managed to squeeze everything in by taking Taylors
bike out of the bag and playing quite a bit of bike tetris.</p>
<p><img alt="Bike tetris" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/559242_10151343880853765_1697281874_n.jpg" />
<img alt="Bike tetris" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/297334_10151343881108765_1615736305_n.jpg" />
<p class="caption">T'was a bit of a squeeze...</p></p>
<p>Once all that faff was done and dusted
we actually managed to get to the airport with plently of time to spare. We checked in etc... and didn't
get charged for the bikes which was nice! A pint and something to eat later and it was boarding time.
We flew with Swiss air and during the flight we got given ice cream and Swiss chocolate, pretty good.
Other than the ice cream and chocolate the flight was a flight. We collected baggage and did all that jazz
before meeting up with the other three guys we were there with - Jase, Rab and NC. I hadn't met
these guys before and they were sound. Transfer from Geneva to Morzine and we arrived at the chalet.</p>
<p><img alt="In the air" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/391489_10151343882083765_1038870302_n.jpg" />

<p><img alt="Sorting everything out at the chalet" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/533069_10151343882638765_1332865463_n.jpg" />
<p class="caption">Sorting everything out at the chalet</p></p>
<p><img alt="The chalet" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/391561_10151343883323765_1509336136_n.jpg" />
<p class="caption">The chalet</p></p>
<p>At this point I feel that I should mention that we were catered for. The chalet was massive,
big enough to hold 26 (I think it was). Upon arriving we met Paul, the chalet manager/chef and he
told us that it was just us and 3 other guys for the whole week. Oh, there was also a hot tub, that's
worth a mention. We unpacked all our stuff and sat down for our first meal of the week. Well,
the food was excellent and stayed that way for the duration of our stay. First night there so we
went out for a few in Morzine, it was fairly quiet but we had a pretty good night.</p>
<p>Sunday, rain, lots of. Slightly hungover and not a good forecast for the day we decided to hold
off on starting the riding for a day, no point in buying a lift pass to find the lifts shut for most
of the day due to storms. Instead we wandered into town for a bite to eat and to get our bearings.
After we'd eaten we had a bit of a wander round and during this time some form of street procession
started up, it was really pretty random. It was mostly vans and large vehicles covered in trees and
tarps etc... To mind I remember there being 101 dalmations - kids on skates being caught by a bloke who put
them into the back of a van. Loads of classic rally cars and a dragon. Yes, a dragon. It was a tractor with
a grab on the front that was covered in a tarp (no, the driver could not see where he was going), the grab meant that
they could move the dragons head which was actually pretty cool! Anyway, that excitement over we bought some beers
and headed back to the chalet where we just chilled out for the rest of the day.</p>
<p><img alt="Randomness" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/599463_10151343885143765_1970476067_n.jpg" />

<img alt="Randomness" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/386849_10151343886573765_1320966890_n.jpg" /></p>
<p>Monday, bikes. We rolled out of the chalet about mid morning and decided to hit up the
Pleney. We bought our lift passes (93 euros for 6 consecutive days I think) and made our
way up to the top via chair lift. Chair lifts are utterly awesome. First run in we
decided to take the blue run just to ease us in. It was fairly bumpy, pretty steep in places and
fairly slick. I think that it's safe to say that we were all a little bit worried about how hard
other tracks would be if this was a blue. It wasn't a blue, it was a black. Taylor had somehow managed
to take us down the wrong one, oh well - at least we felt better that it was black!</p>
<p><img alt="The crew" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/400420_10151343887973765_860735645_n.jpg" />
<p class="caption">The crew for the week, except Ben</p></p>
<p><img alt="Second time lucky" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/394464_10151343888863765_1050098128_n.jpg" />
<p class="caption">Second time lucky</p></p>
<p>Next up we did the blue. This was mostly double tracky fireroad type stuff and was seriously bumpy, braking bumps
were a recurring theme for the week and were not fun on my hardtail. It was a pretty boring track really.
Next up we tried the other black track, this was a good'un! It had steep bits and was twisty and drops and
was fun! It wasn't full of braking bumps as bad as other tracks for some reason and was one of
my favourites of the entire trip, certainly my favourite in the Les Gets &amp; Morzine areas! It also
had a short section called 10% which was just a steep run into a berm or 2, I really thought that I was going to
lose a wheel in the braking bumps going down that.</p>
<p>At this point we stopped for some food and a drink and decided to head over to Les Gets. We rode the linking
section from Morzine and popped out at the top of the bottom section of the Les Gets red line main run.
It started out with a few jumps and then worked it's way down through loads of berms. Pretty fun. By this point
it'd started raining again and the chair lift up to the top was not fun, wet and windy. We pretty swiftly headed
on down the main line. It was jumpy, bermy and wide. Oh, and FULL of braking bumps. Not just a few around corners
and what not but a constant stream of small bumps with a few big ones thrown in for good measure. It was really, really
hard work on the hardtail, gave me a pounding and was difficult to keep up any speed. None-the-less a pretty
fun track that would be a great laugh without the braking bumps! At the bottom of this we were all utterly plastered
in mud, most of us had given up with goggles due to them instantly getting covered. A couple of the guys
were only wearing XC jerseys on their upper half and were getting pretty cold so we decided to call it a day
and ride back along the road to Morzine.</p>
<p><img alt="Cold chairlifts" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/418479_10151343890173765_438921370_n.jpg" />
<img alt="Mudded up" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/557532_10151343890418765_1861521024_n.jpg" />

<p class="caption">No shortage of mud</p></p>
<p>Somehow Ben and I got left for dead going down the road (suspect super tacky
tyres had something to do with it) and we decided to throw in an extra run of the fun black line down Pleney. I really
did like that track! After that it was home for showers, hot tub, food and chilling out. Rab, Jase and NC also managed
to spend 3 hours in the hot tub!</p>
<p><img alt="Winding down" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/557328_10151343892203765_1210675953_n.jpg" />
<p class="caption">Proper way to wind down!</p></p>
<p>Tuesday, dry! Tuesday we decided to head straight over to Les Gets and explore the area a bit more. We got there
and did the main line to warm up, it had dried up a bit and was even bumpier than I remember, didn't hugely enjoy it.
After that run we headed over to the jump park and did a couple of runs over there, they were mostly just berm after berm and
ridiculously bumpy, not ideal for me! A bite to eat and we headed back to the main Les Gets lift to
check out the canyon run. At this point Ben and I also swapped bikes. Wow, the top of the main line was suddenly a lot
more fun! DH bike just took out most of the buzz of the smaller bumps, it was great. We did the top and headed over to the canyon.
This trail was also great, it was rooty, steep in bits, small drops and fairly tight (as the name suggests). There was
another track that ran down with the canyon but jumped across it back and forth, we gave that one a miss! After that track
we decided to try out the other side of Les Gets, this only really had 1 track. It was a good track that was pretty easy
but fast and steep. Oh, and full of braking bumps (getting the theme yet?) but it was still good even though
my arms did die at the bottom each time. We did that a couple of times before calling it day.</p>
<p>Paul had said that most of the guides and chalet guys etc... had Wednesdays off so we decided to head into town
for a few drinks again. It was even quieter than Saturday! We had a few drinks and then Rab, Jase and NC headed back,
I decided to stay with Ben and Taylor but to switch to energy drinks as I didn't fancy getting battered. We had a couple of
drinks before deciding to try Opera which seemed to be the main club, not only was that utterly, utterly dead but also
10 euros for a shot or bottle of beer. We gave up without having a drink there and headed home!</p>
<p>Wednesday, rest. Taylor, Ben and I decided to have a day off and just chill out. Not much happened. The other guys went up
Super Morzine and said that sections were some of the steepest stuff that theyve ever ridden, that made it high on my agenda.</p>
<p>Thursday, disaster. We decided to head up the Super Morzine and then explore over the other side of the mountain and maybe head
to Chatel. The top of Super Morzine is a separate chair lift so you can lap it, we decided that we'd do a single lap of it
before heading further afield. One lap done and I realised that my forks had broken, I had no travel and they were just clunking up and
down. That was that for me, I headed down on the road and headed for the Scott shop which Paul had recommended to us. As chance would
have it Paul was getting ready to go for a ride there and gave me the name of a mechanic at a different shop to
go and have a chat to. Unfortunately he wasn't there so I headed to the chalet and set about fixing the forks. After a lot
of swearing and effort I got the air unit apart (most stupid, stupid system ever). It all looked OK until I realised that
the positive air piston wasn't attached to the rod, it'd blown off - blowing a circlip off in the process. Simple to fix at least,
I put it all back together and too kthe chance to remove the spacer and make them 160mm again. That took me the best part of the
day so I just chilled out until the others returned. Had a bit of a chat about where they'd been and it sounded pretty ace.</p>
<p>Friday, disaster again. Exact same as Thursay, top of Super Morzine I lost all travel. Not happy. Headed into town
and headed straight for the shop Paul had suggested to talk to the mechanic, as luck would have it he was in. His
opinion was that the rod was damaged (I was pretty sure it wasn't) or that the circlip was on upside down. Wait, what?
Yeah, so turns out that circlips aren't all symmetrical and that they have a rounded and a flat edge, flat edge takes the load.
Learn something new every day! Back to the chalet and repaired forks again, by the time I'd finished it was getting on and I'd
lost confidence in the fork so I just chilled out again with the aim of getting a hire bike for Saturday. I asked Paul where
to hire one from and he told me to use his bike (Iron Horse DH bike). Brilliant! What a legend! The other guys
had been over the same as Thursday and had a pretty good time.</p>
<p>Saturday, aaaaace! We headed straight over to Les Linderettes which the guys had said was good. It really was. Having a downhill
bike made so much difference, the braking bumps were still noticeable but the ability to just plough through them at speed
and not lose all control and speed really made the difference. We mostly rode 2 tracks over there, one of which was the
old French national - this was one of my favourite tracks - it was fast with a bit of tech thrown in. We also headed up
the Marmotte on the chair lift, that was a long old lift. Once up there we had a choice of black or red descents, the black seemed
to take us down the wrong side of the mountain so we went for the red. It wasn't amazing, it started out really pedally and then got
a bit more fun although quite wide. Ideal for a hardtail ironically. We spent a good portion of the day riding Les Linderettes before
riding back to Morzine via a goat village (I kid ye not) and a nice lake to swim in for a bit.</p>

<p class="caption">Lake!</p></p>
<p>Sunday, home :(. Nuff said.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a great holiday, big thanks to Paul for that. Next time I won't be taking a hardtail, it's just not the tool for the job
out there for this sort of riding. Next time I think that we're thinking of going somewhere more off the beaten track
too and making more of a road trip out of it, should be ace! Now, to find a full sus frame....</p>
