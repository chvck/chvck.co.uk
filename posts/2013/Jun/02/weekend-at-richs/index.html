    <h2><a href="http://chvck.co.uk/posts/2013/Jun/02/weekend-at-richs/">Weekend at Rich's</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 02 Jun 2013</h3>
        
      <p>On Friday we leave for Scotland so some of us have been scrabbling to get a last
bit of riding prep in before Bean utterly destroys our legs. Harris, Rich and I
decided that we wanted to get a long ride in this weekend. As Rich lives near
good riding and now has his own house we decided to go ride there and stay for the weekend.
Unfortunately, Harris had been ill for a lot of last week and I got the text on Friday afternoon
saying that he wasn't going to make it.</p>
<p>Saturday morning Maura and myself set off for Rich's place, which is only about an away. We arrived
at about lunch, chilled out for a bit and then Rich and I decided we'd better go ride in the Lickey's.
The aim was for a decent sized ride but with the longer ride being Sunday. Gotta say I thought that the
Lickey's were pretty awesome, not a lot of elevation but loads of stuff to ride and a lot of it pretty
steep. Even some small drops and the like. There's plenty of potential there for a bit of cheeky building away from the
beaten path too. </p>

<p class="caption">View over Birmingham from above the golf course</p></p>
<p>As soon as we hit the first climb I could feel something was amiss, my legs were still aching
from Harris destroying them the Saturday before! Whilst I could happily spin away I felt like
I had no actual strength in them and that they were hollow. Luckily, most of the climbs were steep
but not too steep so I could spin them in 1st gear. We did about 26km and it took us 2 hours although
a reasonable chunk was on the road to and from the woods. I'm keen to get back there and explore some
more. The SLX brakes proved themselves to be a worth investment impressing me all the while. The rubber queens
were also good, less draggy as the high rollers but just as grippy - think I'll be using the larsens for
most of my riding over Summer though. </p>

<p class="caption">Second hand RQ, plenty of life - bargain!</p></p>
<p>In the evening we went for a curry which was pretty nice and then a couple of pubs. We wound up in a pub
near to Rich's house that had a live band which was a pretty awesome end to the day.</p>
<p>Sunday, we had arrange to meet another Ben (Bish) at the Wyre at 11. Weeeell, that didn't happen - Rich and I
set off at 11 so we told them to just ride on and we'd bump into them somewhere. We actually wound up
arriving at the Wyre at 11.40. The Wyre was really dry and the descents there are pretty much all fast, flat out. Whilst that isn't
majorly my cup of tea (I prefer more techy stuff) it was awesome fun. There are a couple of pretty techy, steep descents that kept
the bag varied and the climbs are steep but fairly short. My legs felt much better for this ride and Rich was aching from the
previous ride so we had a pretty nice pace. I previously hadn't enjoyed riding the Wyre but 
it's certainly on my list of things worth riding now. In the end we did about 30km in about 2.5 hours (runkeeper managed 
to lose gps signal so not really sure!).</p>

<p class="caption">My bike doesn't fit Rich's rack with the shock on</p></p>
<p>We got back and chilled out for a bit before playing the bike fettling game. I bled my rear brake to try get it
as good as the front, I was not successful in that although it feels no worse than before. Rich decided to try
track down the horrible creak/cracking sound under load on his bike. We took his freehub off and it was pretty obvious,
the bearings quite literally fell out of the body in a number of pieces. So he's got some work to do before Scotland!
Rich then cooked a great chilli and after eating Maura and I returned to Oxford.</p>
<p>A great weekend and hopefully many more to come in Rich's new place. </p>
