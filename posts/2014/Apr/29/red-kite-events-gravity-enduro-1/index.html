    <h2><a href="http://chvck.co.uk/posts/2014/Apr/29/red-kite-events-gravity-enduro-1/">Red Kite Events Gravity Enduro 1</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 29 Apr 2014</h3>
        
      <p>This weekend was the <a href="http://redkite-events.co.uk/index.php">Red Kite Events</a> gravity enduro 1 at Llanwrtyd Wells. This gravity enduro differed
from others that I've seen in that there were no strict stage start times. On Saturday stages were open 2pm-5pm and Sunday 10am - 5pm.
This meant that after finishing a stage you could wait for your mate(s) and then pedal on to the next stage in your own time (within reason).</p>
<h1>Saturday</h1>
<p>Saturday was just 2 stages with practise in the morning. The stages opened at 2pm so I picked Rich up at around 9 and we got to 
Llanwrtyd Wells at about 11.30. We picked up our race plates and decided to crack to get in a practise loop before the stages opened.</p>
<h2>Stage 2</h2>
<p>We practised stage 1 and then moved onto stage 2, which was quite a long way away but the majority of the climb was on a long, shallow fireroad.
As we reached the bottom of stage 2 we met the organisers setting up the timing gate and they told us that we could do stage 2 timed before stage 
1, saving us pedalling back to 1 and then back to 2 again. Stage 2 was exposed with a short, slippery, rooty section at the top followed by a mixture of
flatout loose rocky descents and flat pedally sections all linked with sharp, open hairpins. Finishing with a grassy section into a hairpin and a sprint to the
finish. It was good fun and pretty difficult to ride the hairpins fast. My timed run went pretty well with no major issues but did stall out and have to scoot the bike on the very last corner as
it had an awkward hole toward the exit. Got down in 00:02:52 which put me at 19/25 for the stage.</p>
<h2>Stage 1</h2>
<p>The climb up to stage 1 was a long burner of a fireroad, not too steep but with a pretty viscious headwind for our practise run. Stage 1 itself
was fast singletrack with loose rock, plenty of ruts and a steep bedrock section. It was a fun descent although a bit too flat out for my tastes 
with a bit of a very short, sharp climb toward the end. In my timed run I hit a realy slow line at the top that had me hitting a large grass tuft and nearly coming to a stop. 
I also managed to get stuck in a rut that I didn't want to be in and crashed trying to get out of it. That left me turning into the bedrock chute a bit too sharp and hitting another big grass tuft,
I stayed on the bike but it all got a bit wild. Other than that the run went pretty alright! Got down in 00:03:04 which put me at 18/25 for the stage.</p>
<p>All in all we managed about 34km, quite glad we managed to cut out about 15km by not having to go back to stage 1. After the stages we headed back to race HQ where Neil (the race organiser) 
provided us with a beer each and we had a good chat before another beer and then getting changed. I managed to pick a shower that
didn't go hot at all - a cold shower after a cold, wet ride (did I mention that I also fell off in a river?) was not the one! There aren't many showers in my life that I would describe as emotional but that was one of them.
After getting ready Rich n I headed to the pub for a couple of drinks before heading to the pasta party! As part of the event we had a free pasta meal at the <a href="http://www.food-food-food.co.uk/">Drovers Rest</a>. I opted
for the spag bol and good it was too. The results for the day also appeared, I was coming in at 18th with a time of 05:56:28 (bear in mind that 4 of the 25 riders weren't riding Saturday so just got a flat 5 minutes for each stage). 
Rich was in 13th with 05:03:78. That result was good enough for me! A couple of beers and it was time for bed. Camping in the rain, joy.</p>
<h1>Sunday</h1>
<p>Up at around 8 and ready to go by 9.15, we were the first people to head out. We got to the top of stage 1 at about 10.05 and cracked on.</p>
<h2>Stage 1</h2>
<p>This went much better this time, despite being much more slippery from the rain. I hit the same crap line at the top as I totally forgot about but managed to keep it together for the entire run. It felt slower than Saturday
but I didn't crash and hit better lines so hoped for a better time. Turned out that I got 00:03:08 so slower despite not crashing! This time got me 21st for the stage and still 18th overall. Rich must have had a bit of a problem
as he came in slower than me and lost a couple of places to 16th. </p>
<h2>Stage 2</h2>
<p>This run also felt slower than Saturday but I gave what I could in the sprints and managed to hit a better line around the bottom corner which cut off the actual corner. I had no idea how to stack this one up time wise. 
At the bottom of this stage we bumped into a fella called Chris who had an identical net time as Rich for Saturday. We continued to ride with him until stage 4. He's into his XC racing and seemed to be pretty rapid.
This stage I managed 20th in 00:03:06, another time slower than Saturday. This dropped me down to 19th overall. Rich managed to claw back to 15th after this one.</p>
<h2>Stage 3</h2>
<p>This stage was ridden blind and was a good old pedal from stage 2 but after pedalling back up to the top of stage 2 it stayed on the top of the hill which was pretty nice. There was a short, rocky non-stage descent too :). Stage 3 could be described
only as utterly flatout. The surface was man made and ridiculously fast, mostly quite wide and straight with a couple of corners and hairpins. It went on for quite a while and as I was starting to feel a bit tired a climb appeared.
This was bad news. I dropped several gears and sprinted as well as I could (not very well) before it dropped into descent again. The finish was quite steep with a couple of big corners before the finish line. It was good
but really, really tiring! At this point we found out that one of the timing wands had broken and that we'd have to wait for all riders to come through stage 3 before we could ride stage 4, luckily there was a cafe nearby serving
hot food so we chilled out there for a while (we were the first people to reach the bottom of stage 3) before pedalling up to stage 4. I came in at 00:04:40 in 22nd for the stage keeping me in 19th overall. Rich had gained another place
to 14.</p>
<h2>Stage 4</h2>
<p>Another blind stage. A couple of minutes after we got to stage 4 Neil turned up with the person doing the timing for the stage and told us to ride the top of stage 4 and loop back round as they'd be a few minutes.
This gave us a quick taste of what was to come. The top section was singletrack, wooded, really rooty and really slippery. I was happy! After we looped back round to the top we got ready to go.
I was going to be first off, there was a bit more of a delay and almost everyone was around before I went, including a few who had wandered down into the woods. Bit of pressure! But having people cheering in the woods felt good
and I kept it together. After doing the top section the track got a bit more difficult, less roots but a bit steeper with some steep, sharp corners. This section dropped onto the fireroad in a pretty horrific rut before going really steep
with a few steep, sharp corners. Unfortunately I came unclipped and rode at the finish line with 1 foot on the pedal, no problem BUT there was a bridge just before the finish and I missed it. This meant that I had to get off and 
run to the bridge and on to the finish. This was definitely my favourite stage! The track continued downhill to the cafe after the finish and that bit was pretty good fun too. This was my best stage (relative) to others despite
losing a bit of time at the end, I came in 1s behind Rich at 00:02:09 which was 15th for the stage. Despite this I dropped a place overall to 20th.</p>
<h2>Stage 5</h2>
<p>To get to stage 5 was back the way we came from stage 2 (stage 5 and 2 were the same track). Starting with a steepish, longish climb back to the top of the hill. We made our way back until the route diverted off from the way that 
we came. Everything suddenly went very Dyfi. The track was quite undulating and all bedrock with some massive, deep puddles. It was quite fun but I wouldn't have minded not doing it by that point! We eventually made our way to the
top of the stage and cracked on. I believe the phrase is "had a mare". On the top rooty bit I managed to somehow come off. On the next section which was fast and loose into a hairpin I managed to just not be able to stop and overshot
the corner. Further down I crashed again! Remounted to find my bars were pointing nowhere near where the wheel was so had to dismount and pull them a bit straighter. I was also pretty shot for the sprints but gave what I had.
Definitely my worst run of the day but despite the crashes still finished in one piece which is a win in my books! As expected my time for this one wasn't good, 00:04:05. A minute slower than my run down stage 2 earlier in the day,
and 23rd for the stage.</p>
<p>Sunday turned out to be around 48km so a good size ride. We got back, cleaned bikes, selves and got changed. Had a cup of tea (beer for Rich) and then headed off with a couple of freebies - mucoff silicon spray and an ID system that attaches to your helmet. 
Despite the weather being horrible for pretty much the whole weekend it was a cracking event. I really enjoyed the format, being about to chill out a bit and ride the transitions with Rich. 
The event was quite small which meant that you recognised pretty much everyone when you saw them and made for a nice vibe. Overall I came 21st out of 25 with a clear indicator that to do better I need to be braver on the fast descents. 
Rich finished in 13th a couple of minutes up on me. Overall, I learnt some of the area and didn't muller myself so I'm a happy bunny. Bring on rounds 2 and 3, which apparently will have more stages like 4, woohoo!</p>
