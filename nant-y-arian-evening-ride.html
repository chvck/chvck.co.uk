</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>For the past few xc rides I've not really been feeling the downhills. They've felt
slow and forced to try make any speed on them, it's been fine over Clarach but for
some reason Nant and even the Dyfi just haven't felt right. Last night that changed,
I seemed to get my mojo back, the trails started to flow again and the speed was just there.
I think that dropping the forks down to 140mm has played a part in that as has having
a little less stress on my mind due to finding a place to live!</p>
<p>So, last night I met up with the ystwyth guys at our usual spot up at Nant. I'd elected to
use spd's for this ride, my second offroad ride with them. I decided to use them as I
know the trails well and there isn't anything that I'd be worried about riding in them at all.
The first climb up the pendam climb felt pretty good, could notice the front end flicking up
less with the lower travel and I got up it feeling fine, but still the slowest! We rode over the
moorlands and headed to zorro. Zorro was good and felt fast, the last bit through the trees is
always nice and felt a bit faster this time than my last few rides. One very noticeable thing
so far into the ride was that my rear brake was squealing A LOT and not really doing much
in the way of slowing me down, no matter the front was getting the job done.</p>
<p>Up the leg burner, I found the guys stopped at the 3/4 mark. This was the fastest time
I've got up the 3/4 so far and also felt the best so far, fitness is certainly still
increasing at a fairly good rate. Upto Drunken Druid which felt significantly faster than
the last few times that I've ridden it and I cleared the short, sharp climb after it with
no problems, spd's doing their part there I think. Midway down High as a Kite I had a
bit of an incident with both ends washing out, to my amazement I clipped out without
even thinking about it and got in a dab. That single dab has upped my confidence in the spd's
no end!</p>
<p>Italian job, Hippity Hop and the top of white fridge all rode great, although I did nearly
spd dump at the top of hippity hop! Back at the cars
I felt good. Most enjoyable nant ride that I've had in a while, everything just felt good!
At this point I decided to investigate that squeal, wheel off, pads out. Well, the picture below says
more than I can in words!</p>
