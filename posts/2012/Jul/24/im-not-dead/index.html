    <h3>Posted on 24 Jul 2012</h3>
        
      <p>Been a little while since I made any posts, about 3 weeks in fact - feels a lot longer I can tell you.
May as well start at the beginning - the move. Well, actually there's not a lot to say on that front,
it all went rather well really. Everything was packed and in the vehicles (Ben came to help with his van) by about 2pm
I think. The drive itself was fine, no mishaps or owt. Upon arriving at the new house we pretty much just got everything
out of the vehicles and dumped it all in the house before shooting into Oxford for some food. Sunday we went and rode
Aston Hill, wow that place is slick in the wet! My brakes were still binding terribly so the push up was pretty damn
unenjoyable though.</p>
<p>Anyway, 3.5 weeks on and the house is a bit more presentable and has a touch more furniture - we're still sleeping
on a sofa bed though. We managed to get a book cake and a bureau from one of my work colleagues and just yesterday we picked
up a small cupboard Maura spotted on freecycle. I have an office setup in the spare bedroom which is serving me well. (ha, we've just had a power cut
as I type this) The cat appears to have settled in no problems and has tackled the great outdoors of the back yard.
Not a lot else to say on this matter really.</p>
<p>So, what's happened in the time period since moving here? Actually, not really that much again. Seb got married the first
weekend which was pretty cool and was fun! I've been on one road ride with Jimbo and will hopefully increase the frequency
of the road rides by joining a local club called Zappi's. I went on the speed awareness course because I got caught speeding
(might actually write a post about that...). Most of the time has just been spent working or sitting around really!
But all is going well and hopefully Maura will find a job soon which will take the financial strain off!</p>
