    <h2><a href="http://chvck.co.uk/posts/2013/Apr/01/aberystwyth-easter-trip/">Aberystwyth Easter Trip</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 01 Apr 2013</h3>
        
      <p>Easter weekend we had decided to rent out a caravan and do the nant-mach-nant ride. There would be Ben, Rich,
Jase, Pete, Rob and myself staying in the caravan and we'd do the ride with Dave and the ystwyth MTB crew.
We also planned to do a bit of Clarach and maybe Myherin too.</p>
<h2>Friday</h2>
<p>Early start, packed the car and was en-route to Ben's at 6.20am. The drive was good and I turned up
at 8.20, I had to wait 5 minutes for Ben to turn up but then we cracked on with the bike fettling. On my list of
things were to do were: cut down steerer, check damper circuit for fluid, change brake pads, perform volume
reduction mod on shock, bleed front brake and change chain ring. Not a huge list but these things always take time,
surprisingly we had an hour to spare before Rich turned up at about 11.30. A bit of fettling on his bike and we
were on our way to aber.</p>
<p><img alt="Fettling with my bike" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/5271_10151819648193765_874543417_n.jpg" />
<p class="caption">A bit of fettling with my bike!</p></p>

<p class="caption">Adding a shim to my shock for the volume reduction</p></p>
<p>The weather on the drive over to aber was sunny the whole way and aber itself no different. We checked in at
<a href="http://www.aberystwyth-holidays.co.uk/">Aberystwyth holiday village</a> and headed over to the caravan to
get changed and drop stuff off. The caravan was pretty big. Basic but everything we needed. We did everything
that we needed and cracked on over to Clarach woods for some mini-DH.</p>
<p><img alt="Driving to aber" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/543703_10151819649293765_892519870_n.jpg" />
<p class="caption">The drive over to aber</p></p>
<p>The trails were dry and riding brilliantly.
We spent a couple of hours there riding various tracks before heading back to the caravan. This was the first proper
downhill stuff that I'd ridden on my full sus and it was taking a bit of getting used to but felt really good.
We got back to the caravan park just after the other guys pulled in which worked out well.</p>

<h2>Saturday</h2>
<p>Big ride day. We were going to do the nant to mach and back with the ystwyth mtb guys. We managed to get to
Morrisons at about 9.15 to get some breakfast at the cafe and grab some riding food. The cafe food was somewhat
less than average! We turned up to Pendam car park at about 10 to find Dave and Pete already there ready to go.</p>
<p><img alt="Breakfast" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/564739_10151819654738765_811641672_n.jpg" />
<p class="caption">A bit of breakfast</p></p>
<p>A bit of faffing and we were off out away from nant on the conti loop. At this point I feel I should mention
that the fresh brake pads meant that my front wheel wasn't spinning freely at all! Anyway, we got to Anglers Retreat in fairly good
time but there was a bit of snow on the ground. Dave and Pete made the decision to try a different route out to the mach 3
as they expected too much snow on the other. We cracked on and were met with deep snow and icy conditions everywhere.
Dave floated the idea that we maybe abandon the plan as it'd just be a slog and not much fun. In the end we came
up with the idea to ride to the mach 3 and then back to nant on a slightly different route to make a bit of a loop.</p>
<p><img alt="Lovely day" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/733889_10151819654963765_2082049772_n.jpg" />

<p class="caption">It begins...</p></p>
<p>The snow didn't improve, we spent quite a lot of time hiking the bikes through the snow with the odd bit of riding where
the snow was conpact enough to allow it or the trail went downhill. I had a nice lie down/slide on my arse going
round a corner and had thought I'd broken my lev but it turned out to be a bit of outer cabling had got stuck, phew!
We got back to Anglers Retreat via scaletrix and most of the ride back to the conti loop was actually ride-able. We did
the ace descent back down to the conti loop and returned to nant via sidewinder and hippity hop. At this point
Dave and Pete headed off home but Ben was keen to go do a bit more riding. There was a general lack of motivation
within the rest of the group though. I was shot but if everyone else wanted to keep going I was happy to do so on the conditions
that I'd probably have to walk the worst bits of climbs. In the end we decided to call it a day.</p>
<p><img alt="A bit of a walk" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/734571_10151819657043765_1569007908_n.jpg" />
<p class="caption">There was plenty of this!</p></p>

<p class="caption">What, no snow?</p></p>
<p>Fantastic day out that, whilst it didn't go to plan, was still great fun and a bit of an adventure. Big thanks to
Dave and Pete for guiding us!</p>
<p>In the evening we wound up in Lopburi Thai Restraunt for food and as always the food was top notch. I had a chicken
panang curry made "as hot as you can". It was most excellent. We popped along to spoons for a pint to start the night out.
After said pint we wound up going back to the caravan park due to everyone being knackered!</p>

<h2>Sunday</h2>
<p>We had no plans for Sunday other than to just ride something. We had a bit of a slow morning getting up late
and tidying the caravan/packing our stuff away. We wound up having a Spoons breakfast and we about ready to go
ride at midday, destination: Clarach. Having seen how dry it was on Friday and we had such a good laugh we decided that
we had to go back and to also show the other guys who hadn't been there before. We spent a good 4-5 hours in the woods
and had a brilliant time. Rob, Ben and I did the big double which was a big thing for Ben as it managed to get in his
head and he's spent about 3 years trying to get up to doing it. The trails were riding brilliant and were all
really fast, was a brilliant way to spend the afternoon and I think that the only crash was mine too! Luckily I got
out unscathed.</p>
