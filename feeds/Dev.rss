Hat tournaments are tournaments where individuals join rather than teams, all players names are put
into a hat and teams are formed randomly by taking names from the hat. This works fine for smaller tournaments
where everyone knows each others abilities. Teams can be created pretty quickly and then players jiggled around
to make sure that the teams are fair. When tournaments are bigger this isn't so easy. As I play frisbee this explanation
is geared around it. Tournaments such as the Durham Hat and Duffa Hat request that all players provide a few bits of information
such as cutting skill, handling skill, gender etc... I don't actually know but I assume that someone or a few people
then sit down and create teams as fairly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago Mwnci See (Aberystwyth Ultimate) hosted their 15 year reunion tournament, a hat tournament. The
 committee approached me to see if I could write something to knock the teams together to save anyone having to sit
 there and try work them out. Off the back of that I decided to improve the tool I created a bit and create a web app free
 to all to use. So in the end I opted to implement both csv uploading and manual player adding methods, although manually
 adding players would pretty unbearable so I'm not going to touch on that much. Once a csv is uploaded (or player added if
 going manual) then all the players are populated in a big table, I used &lt;a href="http://www.trirand.com/blog/"&gt;jqgrid&lt;/a&gt; for this bit
 as we use it at work so I know my way around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cell is editable so names can be altered, numbers updated etc... Once all of the players are setup correctly it's time for the
 bit that matters. Assigning each column a weight so that attributes can be geared toward how the user wants. If the decides
 that handling makes for a "better" player then they can weight that attribute higher than any others. Using my example csv
 the attributes available are cutting, handling, years since playing and experience. So if I wanted to created teams
 where the cutting and handling abilities are balanced but amplified, the experience taken into account and the years since playing acting
 as a negative thing then I could create an equation of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Handling&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; 2&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Experience&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; 1&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Cutting&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; 2&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Years&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Since&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Playing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once I've created my team generating formula I'd need to set the number of teams and whether or not I'd want to balance genders.
 Once done I hit generate and I get back a csv of balanced teams. The way that the balancing works is that each player has the
 formula provided applied to their attributes and they're given a rating, better players will have a higher rating using my
 formula. The list of players is then sorted into a list with the highest rated players at the top. The teams are then created
 as empty lists and the team list is iterated over giving each team a player using a weighted random selector that weights toward the start of
 the players list. This goes on until all players are assigned to a team, this is done for both males and females separately if
 balance genders was selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the technical bit. The javascript involved in this is all pretty straight forward, just standard jquery stuff really. One
 new thing that I discovered was jquery forms that allow you to submit a http form to your server using a get request. My reasoning
 for doing this is that I didn't want to do a page refresh and have to reload the csv into the grid, I wanted it to be as
 seamless as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">chuck</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 14 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:chvck.co.uk,2012-10-14:posts/2012/Oct/14/hat-team-generator/</guid><category>javascript</category><category>python</category><category>webdev</category></item></channel></rss>
